      "title": "The Effect of Linkage on Establishment and Survival of Locally Beneficial Mutations",
      "abstractNote": "We study invasion and survival of weakly beneficial mutations arising in linkage to an established migration\u2013selection polymorphism. Our focus is on a continent\u2013island model of migration, with selection at two biallelic loci for adaptation to the island environment. Combining branching and diffusion processes, we provide the theoretical basis for understanding the evolution of islands of divergence, the genetic architecture of locally adaptive traits, and the importance of so-called \u201cdivergence hitchhiking\u201d relative to other mechanisms, such as \u201cgenomic hitchhiking\u201d, chromosomal inversions, or translocations. We derive approximations to the invasion probability and the extinction time of a de novo mutation. Interestingly, the invasion probability is maximized at a nonzero recombination rate if the focal mutation is sufficiently beneficial. If a proportion of migrants carries a beneficial background allele, the mutation is less likely to become established. Linked selection may increase the survival time by several orders of magnitude. By altering the timescale of stochastic loss, it can therefore affect the dynamics at the focal site to an extent that is of evolutionary importance, especially in small populations. We derive an effective migration rate experienced by the weakly beneficial mutation, which accounts for the reduction in gene flow imposed by linked selection. Using the concept of the effective migration rate, we also quantify the long-term effects on neutral variation embedded in a genome with arbitrarily many sites under selection. Patterns of neutral diversity change qualitatively and quantitatively as the position of the neutral locus is moved along the chromosome. This will be useful for population-genomic inference. Our results strengthen the emerging view that physically linked selection is biologically relevant if linkage is tight or if selection at the background locus is strong.",

Here, we use DNA polymorphism data and genome-wide variation in recombination rate to jointly infer the strength and timing of selection, as well as the baseline level of gene flow under various demographic scenarios. We model how divergent selection leads to a genome-wide negative correlation between recombination rate and genetic differentiation among populations. Our theory shows that the selection density (i.e., the selection coefficient per base pair) is a key parameter underlying this relationship. We then develop a procedure for parameter estimation that accounts for the confounding effect of background selection. Applying this method to two datasets from Mimulus guttatus, we infer a strong signal of adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow between populations growing on and off phytotoxic serpentine soils. However, the genome-wide intensity of this selection is not exceptional compared with what M. guttatus populations may typically experience when adapting to local conditions. We also find that selection against genome-wide introgression from the selfing sister species M. nasutus has acted to maintain a barrier between these two species over at least the last 250 ky. Our study provides a theoretical framework for linking genome-wide patterns of divergence and recombination with the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that drive this differentiation.",

      "abstractNote": "Although verbal theories of speciation consider landscape changes, ecological speciation is usually modelled in a fixed geographical arrangement. Yet landscape changes occur, at different spatio-temporal scales, due to geological, climatic or ecological processes, and these changes result in repeated divisions and reconnections of populations. We examine the effect of such landscape dynamics on speciation. We use a stochastic, sexual population model with polygenic inheritance, embedded in a landscape dynamics model (allopatry-sympatry oscillations). We show that, under stabilizing selection, allopatry easily generates diversity, but species coexistence is evolutionarily unsustainable. Allopatry produces refuges whose persistence depends on the characteristic time scales of the landscape dynamics. Under disruptive selection, assuming that sympatric speciation is impossible due to Mendelian inheritance, allopatry is necessary for ecological differentiation. The completion of reproductive isolation, by reinforcement, then requires several sympatric phases. These results demonstrate that the succession of past, current and future geographical arrangements considerably influence the speciation process.",

      "abstractNote": "Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.",

      "abstractNote": "We consider a population subdivided into two demes connected by migration in which selection acts in opposite direction. We explore the effects of recombination and migration on the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism, on local adaptation, and on differentiation by employing a deterministic model with genic selection on two linked diallelic loci (i.e., no dominance or epistasis). For the following cases, we characterize explicitly the possible equilibrium configurations: weak, strong, highly asymmetric, and super-symmetric migration, no or weak recombination, and independent or strongly recombining loci. For independent loci (linkage equilibrium) and for completely linked loci, we derive the possible bifurcation patterns as functions of the total migration rate, assuming all other parameters are fixed but arbitrary. For these and other cases, we determine analytically the maximum migration rate below which a stable fully polymorphic equilibrium exists. In this case, differentiation and local adaptation are maintained. Their degree is quantified by a new multilocus version of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$F_\\mathrm{ST}$$\\end{document} and by the migration load, respectively. In addition, we investigate the invasion conditions of locally beneficial mutants and show that linkage to a locus that is already in migration-selection balance facilitates invasion. Hence, loci of much smaller effect can invade than predicted by one-locus theory if linkage is sufficiently tight. We study how this minimum amount of linkage admitting invasion depends on the migration pattern. This suggests the emergence of clusters of locally beneficial mutations, which may form \u2018genomic islands of divergence\u2019. Finally, the influence of linkage and two-way migration on the effective migration rate at a linked neutral locus is explored. Numerical work complements our analytical results.",

      "abstractNote": "We use individual-based stochastic simulations and analytical deterministic predictions to investigate the interaction between drift, natural selection and gene flow on the patterns of local adaptation across a fragmented species\u2019 range under clinally varying selection. Migration between populations follows a stepping-stone pattern and density decreases from the centre to the periphery of the range. Increased migration worsens gene swamping in small marginal populations but mitigates the effect of drift by replenishing genetic variance and helping purge deleterious mutations. Contrary to the deterministic prediction that increased connectivity within the range always inhibits local adaptation, simulations show that low intermediate migration rates improve fitness in marginal populations and attenuate fitness heterogeneity across the range. Such migration rates are optimal in that they maximize the total mean fitness at the scale of the range. Optimal migration rates increase with shallower environmental gradients, smaller marginal populations and higher mutation rates affecting fitness.",

      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation and dispersal evolution are key evolutionary processes shaping the invasion dynamics of populations colonizing new environments. Yet their interaction is largely unresolved. Using a single-species population model along a one-dimensional environmental gradient, we show how local competition and dispersal jointly shape the eco-evolutionary dynamics and speed of invasion. From a focal introduction site, the generic pattern predicted by our model features a temporal transition from wave-like to pulsed invasion. Each regime is driven primarily by local adaptation, while the transition is caused by eco-evolutionary feedbacks mediated by dispersal. The interaction range and cost of dispersal arise as key factors of the duration and speed of each phase. Our results demonstrate that spatial eco-evolutionary feedbacks along environmental gradients can drive strong temporal variation in the rate and structure of population spread, and must be considered to better understand and forecast invasion rates and range dynamics.",

      "abstractNote": "Conditional dispersal, in which an individual\u2019s decision over whether to disperse is a response to environmental conditions, features prominently in studies of dispersal evolution. Using models of clines, I examine how one widely discussed cost of dispersal, namely, that dispersal impedes local adaptation, changes with conditional dispersal and what this implies for dispersal evolution. I examine the consequences for dispersal evolution of the responsiveness of dispersal to the environment, the accuracy of any proximal cues that individuals rely upon to assess habitat quality, and whether dispersal responds to fitness itself or only to some fitness components (juvenile survivorship). All of the conditional dispersal behaviors that I consider weaken the indirect cost of dispersal inhibiting local adaptation. However, if individuals rely on imprecise cues to assess habitat quality and base dispersal decisions on juvenile survivorship, then conditional dispersal can incur additional costs by exacerbating overcrowding. Conditional dispersal initially leads to steeper clines in traits under direct selection, but when dispersiveness can itself evolve, conditional dispersal allows sigmoidal clines to persist long after those obtained with unconditional movement would become stepped.",

      "abstractNote": "An improved understanding of dispersal behavior is needed to predict how populations and communities respond to habitat fragmentation. Most spatial dynamic theory concentrates on random dispersal, in which movement rates depend neither on the state of an individual nor its environment and movement directions are unbiased. We examine the neglected dispersal component of directed movement in which dispersal is a conditional and directional response of individuals to varying environmental conditions. Specifically, we assume that individuals bias their movements along local gradients in fitness. Random movers, unable to track heterogeneous environmental conditions, face source\u2010sink dynamics, which can result in deterministic extinction or increase their vulnerability to stochastic extinction. Directed movers track environmental conditions closely. In fluctuating environments, random movers \u201cspread their bets\u201d across patches, while directed movers invest offspring in habitats currently enjoying propitious conditions. The autocorrelation in the environment determines each strategy\u2019s success. Random movers permeate entire landscapes, but directed movers are more geographically constrained. Local information constraints limit the ranges of directed movers and introduce a role for historical contingency in determining their ultimate distribution. These geographic differences have implications for biodiversity. Random movement maintains biodiversity through local coexistence, but directed movement favors a spatial partitioning of species.",

For example, these assumptions underpin explanations for clines on the basis of a trade\u2010off between dispersal and local adaptation. We reexamine clines when an individual\u2019s decisions over whether and where to disperse depend on its fitness. We compare fitness\u2010dependent dispersal with cases where dispersal responds to juvenile survivorship only. Clines are steeper the more responsive dispersal is to environmental conditions for all dispersal behaviors that we consider. Clines eventually become stepped as the responsiveness of dispersal to environmental conditions is increased for half of the dispersal behaviors we consider, but smooth clines are maintained for the remaining cases.

      "title": "Evolution of dispersal in density regulated populations: A haploid model",
      "abstractNote": "The evolution of dispersal is explored in a density-dependent framework. Attention is restricted to haploid populations in which the genotypic fitnesses at a single diallelic locus are decreasing functions of the changing number of individuals in the population. It is shown that migration between two populations in which the genotypic response to density is reversed can maintain both alleles when the intermigration rates are constant or nondecreasing functions of the population densities. There is always a unique symmetric interior equilibrium with equal numbers but opposite gene frequencies in the two populations, provided the system is not degenerate. Numerical examples with exponential and hyperbolic fitnesses suggest that this is the only stable equilibrium state under constant positive migration rates (m) less than 12. Practically speaking, however, there is only convergence after a reasonable number of generations for relatively small migration rates (m < 14). A migration-modifying mutant at a second, neutral locus, can successfully enter two populations at a stable migration-selection balance if and only if it reduces the intermigration rates of its carriers at the original equilibrium population size. Moreover, migration modification will always result in a higher equilibrium population size, provided the system approaches another symmetric interior equilibrium. The new equilibrium migration rate will be lower than that at the original equilibrium, even when the modified migration rate is a nondecreasing function of the population sizes. Therefore, as in constant viability models, evolution will lead to reduced dispersal.",

      "abstractNote": "Geneflow across populations is a critical determinant of population genetic structure, divergence, and local adaptation. While evolutionary theory typically envisions geneflow as a continuous connection among populations, many processes make it fluctuating and intermittent. We analyze a mainland-island model where migration occurs as recurrent \"pulses.\" We derive mathematical predictions regarding how the level of migration pulsedness affects the effective migration rate, for neutral and selected mainland alleles. We find that migration pulsedness can either decrease or increase geneflow, depending on the selection regime. Pulsedness increases geneflow for sufficiently (counter)selected alleles (s < s(1)), but reduces it otherwise. We provide a mathematical approximation of the threshold selection strength s1, which is verified in stochastic simulations. Migration pulsedness thus affects the fixation rate at different loci in opposite directions, in a way that cannot be described as a change in effective population size. We show that migration pulsedness would generally reduce the level of local adaptation and introduce an additional genetic load: the \"pulsedness load.\" This is detrimental to the adaptation and persistence of small peripheral populations, with implications in management and conservation. These results indicate temporal variability in migration patterns may be an important, yet understudied, controller of geneflow and local adaptation.",

      "abstractNote": "Hybridization is common in nature, even between \"good\" species. This observation poses the question of why reinforcement is not always successful in leading to the evolution of complete reproductive isolation. To study this question, we developed a new \"quasi-linkage disequilibrium\" (QLD) approximation to obtain the first analytic results for the evolution of modifiers that increase mate discrimination against hybrids and heterospecifics. When such modifiers have small effects, they evolve more readily under a one-allele than a two-allele mechanism (sensu Felsenstein 1981). The strength of selection on the modifier decreases as hybrids decrease in frequency, and so further reinforcement may not occur once hybridization is sufficiently rare. The outcome is qualitatively different when modifiers have large effects, however, for example, when a single mutation can cause complete reproductive isolation. In this case, modifiers in a two-allele mechanism can be selected as or more strongly than those in a one-allele mechanism. Furthermore, they can spread under quite general conditions. Thus, whether complete closure of genetic introgression by reinforcement occurs may depend on the size of effects that mutations have on the sensory systems used in mate choice.",

      "abstractNote": "How much gene flow is needed to inhibit speciation by the accumulation of Dobzhansky\u2013Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) in a structured population? Here, we derive these limits in a classical migration\u2013selection model with two haploid or diploid loci and unidirectional gene flow from a continent to an island. We discuss the dependence of the maximum gene-flow rate on ecological factors (exogeneous selection), genetic factors (epistasis, recombination), and the evolutionary history. Extensive analytical and numerical results show the following: (1) The maximum rate of gene flow is limited by exogeneous selection. In particular, maintenance of neutral DMIs is impossible with gene flow. (2) There are two distinct mechanisms that drive DMI evolution in parapatry, selection against immigrants in a heterogeneous environment and selection against hybrids due to the incompatibility. (3) Depending on the mechanism, opposite predictions result concerning the genetic architecture that maximizes the rate of gene flow a DMI can sustain. Selection against immigrants favors evolution of tightly linked DMIs of arbitrary strength, whereas selection against hybrids promotes the evolution of strong unlinked DMIs. In diploids, the fitness of the double heterozygotes is the decisive factor to predict the pattern of DMI stability.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper investigates the dynamic behaviour of hybrid zones which are maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids. In the first section it is shown that a hybrid zone involving a single locus can move in response to a selective imbalance between the two homozygotes, and also to variation in population density and dispersal rate. It can be trapped by natural barriers, and so an allele which is selected against when rare cannot advance, even if it is advantageous when common. The continuous model used in deriving these results is shown to be a good approximation to the stepping-stone model, provided that the cline contains several demes.",

      "title": "Establishment in a new habitat by polygenic adaptation",
      "abstractNote": "Maladapted individuals can only colonise a new habitat if they can evolve a positive growth rate fast enough to avoid extinction, a process known as evolutionary rescue. We treat log fitness at low density in the new habitat as a single polygenic trait and use the infinitesimal model to follow the evolution of the growth rate; this assumes that the trait values of offspring of a sexual union are normally distributed around the mean of the parents' trait values, with variance that depends only on the parents' relatedness. The probability that a single migrant can establish depends on just two parameters: the mean and genetic variance of the trait in the source population. The chance of success becomes small if migrants come from a population with mean growth rate in the new habitat more than a few standard deviations below zero; this chance depends roughly equally on the probability that the initial founder is unusually fit, and on the subsequent increase in growth rate of its offspring as a result of selection. The loss of genetic variation during the founding event is substantial, but highly variable. With continued migration at rate M, establishment is inevitable; when migration is rare, the expected time to establishment decreases inversely with M. However, above a threshold migration rate, the population may be trapped in a 'sink' state, in which adaptation is held back by gene flow; above this threshold, the expected time to establishment increases exponentially with M. This threshold behaviour is captured by a deterministic approximation, which assumes a Gaussian distribution of the trait in the founder population with mean and variance evolving deterministically. By assuming a constant genetic variance, we also develop a diffusion approximation for the joint distribution of population size and trait mean, which extends to include stabilising selection and density regulation. Divergence of the population from its ancestors causes partial reproductive isolation, which we measure through the reproductive value of migrants into the newly established population.",

Now that so many species and ecosystems face major environmental change, the ability of species to adapt to these changes by dispersing, migrating, or moving between different patches of habitat can be crucial to ensuring their survivial. This book provides a timely and wide-ranging overview of the study of dispersal and incorporates much of the latest research. The causes, mechanisms, and consequences of dispersal at the individual, population, species and community levels are considered. The potential of new techniques and models for studying dispersal, drawn from molecular biology and demography, is also explored. Perspectives and insights are offered from the fields of evolution, conservation biology and genetics. Throughout the book, theoretical approaches are combined with empirical data, and care has been taken to include examples from as wide a range of species as possible.",

      "abstractNote": "A species distributed across diverse environments may adapt to local conditions. We ask how quickly such a species changes its range in response to changed conditions. Sz\u00e9p et al. (Sz\u00e9p E, Sachdeva H, Barton NH. 2021 Polygenic local adaptation in metapopulations: a stochastic eco-evolutionary model. Evolution 75, 1030-1045 (doi:10.1111/evo.14210)) used the infinite island model to find the stationary distribution of allele frequencies and deme sizes. We extend this to find how a metapopulation responds to changes in carrying capacity, selection strength, or migration rate when deme sizes are fixed. We further develop a 'fixed-state' approximation. Under this approximation, polymorphism is only possible for a narrow range of habitat proportions when selection is weak compared to drift, but for a much wider range otherwise. When rates of selection or migration relative to drift change in a single deme of the metapopulation, the population takes a time of order m-1 to reach the new equilibrium. However, even with many loci, there can be substantial fluctuations in net adaptation, because at each locus, alleles randomly get lost or fixed. Thus, in a finite metapopulation, variation may gradually be lost by chance, even if it would persist in an infinite metapopulation. When conditions change across the whole metapopulation, there can be rapid change, which is predicted well by the fixed-state approximation. This work helps towards an understanding of how metapopulations extend their range across diverse environments. This article is part of the theme issue 'Species' ranges in the face of changing environments (Part II)'.",

      "title": "Likelihood-Free Inference of Population Structure and Local Adaptation in a Bayesian Hierarchical Model",
      "abstractNote": "We address the problem of finding evidence of natural selection from genetic data, accounting for the confounding effects of demographic history. In the absence of natural selection, gene genealogies should all be sampled from the same underlying distribution, often approximated by a coalescent model. Selection at a particular locus will lead to a modified genealogy, and this motivates a number of recent approaches for detecting the effects of natural selection in the genome as \u201coutliers\u201d under some models. The demographic history of a population affects the sampling distribution of genealogies, and therefore the observed genotypes and the classification of outliers. Since we cannot see genealogies directly, we have to infer them from the observed data under some model of mutation and demography. Thus the accuracy of an outlier-based approach depends to a greater or a lesser extent on the uncertainty about the demographic and mutational model. A natural modeling framework for this type of problem is provided by Bayesian hierarchical models, in which parameters, such as mutation rates and selection coefficients, are allowed to vary across loci. It has proved quite difficult computationally to implement fully probabilistic genealogical models with complex demographies, and this has motivated the development of approximations such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). In ABC the data are compressed into summary statistics, and computation of the likelihood function is replaced by simulation of data under the model. In a hierarchical setting one may be interested both in hyperparameters and parameters, and there may be very many of the latter\u2014for example, in a genetic model, these may be parameters describing each of many loci or populations. This poses a problem for ABC in that one then requires summary statistics for each locus, which, if used naively, leads to a consequent difficulty in conditional density estimation. We develop a general method for applying ABC to Bayesian hierarchical models, and we apply it to detect microsatellite loci influenced by local selection. We demonstrate using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis that this approach has comparable performance to a full-likelihood method and outperforms it when mutation rates are variable across loci.",

      "abstractNote": "Loci that show unusually low or high levels of genetic differentiation are often assumed to be subject to natural selection. We propose a method for the identification of loci showing such disparities. The differentiation can be quantified using the statistic FST. For a range of population structures and demographic histories, the distribution of FST is strongly related to the heterozygosity at a locus. Outlying values of FST can be identified in a plot of FSTvs. heterozygosity using a null distribution generated by a simple genetic model. We use published data-sets to illustrate the importance of the relationship with heterozygosity. We investigate a number of models of population structure, and demonstrate that the null distribution is robust to a wide range of conditions. In particular, the distribution is robust to differing mutation rates, and therefore different molecular markers, such as allozymes, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPS) and single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPS) can be compared together. We suggest that genetic variation at a discrepant locus, Identified under these conditions, is likely to have been influenced by natural selection, either acting on the locus itself or at a closely linked locus.",

      "abstractNote": "The identification of signatures of natural selection in genomic surveys has become an area of intense research, stimulated by the increasing ease with which genetic markers can be typed. Loci identified as subject to selection may be functionally important, and hence (weak) candidates for involvement in disease causation. They can also be useful in determining the adaptive differentiation of populations, and exploring hypotheses about speciation. Adaptive differentiation has traditionally been identified from differences in allele frequencies among different populations, summarised by an estimate of FST. Low outliers relative to an appropriate neutral population-genetics model indicate loci subject to balancing selection, whereas high outliers suggest adaptive (directional) selection. However, the problem of identifying statistically significant departures from neutrality is complicated by confounding effects on the distribution of FST estimates, and current methods have not yet been tested in large-scale simulation experiments. Here, we simulate data from a structured population at many unlinked, diallelic loci that are predominantly neutral but with some loci subject to adaptive or balancing selection. We develop a hierarchical-Bayesian method, implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and assess its performance in distinguishing the loci simulated under selection from the neutral loci. We also compare this performance with that of a frequentist method, based on moment-based estimates of FST. We find that both methods can identify loci subject to adaptive selection when the selection coefficient is at least five times the migration rate. Neither method could reliably distinguish loci under balancing selection in our simulations, even when the selection coefficient is twenty times the migration rate.",

      "abstractNote": "Although haplodiploidy is widespread in nature, the evolutionary consequences of this mode of reproduction are not well characterized. Here, we examine how genome-wide hemizygosity and a lack of recombination in haploid males affects genomic differentiation in populations that diverge via natural selection while experiencing gene flow. First, we simulated diploid and haplodiploid \"genomes\" (500-kb loci) evolving under an isolation-with-migration model with mutation, drift, selection, migration and recombination; and examined differentiation at neutral sites both tightly and loosely linked to a divergently selected site. As long as there is divergent selection and migration, sex-limited hemizygosity and recombination cause elevated differentiation (i.e., produce a \"faster-haplodiploid effect\") in haplodiploid populations relative to otherwise equivalent diploid populations, for both recessive and codominant mutations. Second, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data to model divergence history and describe patterns of genomic differentiation between sympatric populations of Neodiprion lecontei and N. pinetum, a pair of pine sawfly species (order: Hymenoptera; family: Diprionidae) that are specialized on different pine hosts. These analyses support a history of continuous gene exchange throughout divergence and reveal a pattern of heterogeneous genomic differentiation that is consistent with divergent selection on many unlinked loci. Third, using simulations of haplodiploid and diploid populations evolving according to the estimated divergence history of N. lecontei and N. pinetum, we found that divergent selection would lead to higher differentiation in haplodiploids. Based on these results, we hypothesize that haplodiploids undergo divergence-with-gene-flow and sympatric speciation more readily than diploids.",

      "abstractNote": "Dispersal, whether in the form of a dandelion seed drifting on the breeze, or a salmon migrating upstream to breed in a nonnatal stream, transports genes between locations. At these locations, local adaptation modifies the gene frequencies so their carriers are better suited to particular conditions, be those of newly disturbed soil or a quiet river pool. Both dispersal and local adaptation are major drivers of population structure; however, in general, their respective roles are not independent and the two may often be at odds with one another evolutionarily, each one exhibiting negative feedback on the evolution of the other. Here, we investigate their joint evolution within a simple, discrete-time, metapopulation model. Depending on environmental conditions, their evolutionary interplay leads to either a monomorphic population of highly dispersing generalists or a collection of rarely dispersing, locally adapted, polymorphic sub-populations, each adapted to a particular habitat type. A critical value of environmental heterogeneity divides these two selection regimes and the nature of the transition between them is determined by the level of kin competition. When kin competition is low, at the transition we observe discontinuities, bistability, and hysteresis in the evolved strategies; however, when high, kin competition moderates the evolutionary feedback and the transition is smooth.",

      "abstractNote": "Natural, agricultural and human populations are structured, with a proportion of interactions occurring locally or within social groups rather than at random. This within-population spatial and social structure is important to the evolution of parasites but little attention has been paid to how spatial structure affects the evolution of host resistance, and as a consequence the coevolutionary outcome. We examine the evolution of resistance across a range of mixing patterns using an approximate mathematical model and stochastic simulations. As reproduction becomes increasingly local, hosts are always selected to increase resistance. More localized transmission also selects for higher resistance, but only if reproduction is also predominantly local. If the hosts disperse, lower resistance evolves as transmission becomes more local. These effects can be understood as a combination of genetic (kin) and ecological structuring on individual fitness. When hosts and parasites coevolve, local interactions select for hosts with high defence and parasites with low transmissibility and virulence. Crucially, this means that more population mixing may lead to the evolution of both fast-transmitting highly virulent parasites and reduced resistance in the host.",

      "title": "The coupling hypothesis: why genome scans may fail to map local adaptation genes",
      "abstractNote": "Genomic scans of multiple populations often reveal marker loci with greatly increased differentiation between populations. Often this differentiation coincides in space with contrasts in ecological factors, forming a genetic\u2013environment association (GEA). GEAs imply a role for local adaptation, and so it is tempting to conclude that the strongly differentiated markers are themselves under ecologically based divergent selection, or are closely linked to loci under such selection. Here, we highlight an alternative and neglected explanation: intrinsic (i.e. environment-independent) pre- or post-zygotic genetic incompatibilities rather than local adaptation can be responsible for increased differentiation. Intrinsic genetic incompatibilities create endogenous barriers to gene flow, also known as tension zones, whose location can shift over time. However, tension zones have a tendency to become trapped by, and therefore to coincide with, exogenous barriers due to ecological selection. This coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can occur easily in spatially subdivided populations, even if the loci involved are unlinked. The result is that local adaptation explains where genetic breaks are positioned, but not necessarily their existence, which can be best explained by endogenous incompatibilities. More precisely, we show that (i) the coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can easily occur even when ecological selection is weak; (ii) when environmental heterogeneity is fine-grained, GEAs can emerge at incompatibility loci, but only locally, in places where habitats and gene pools are sufficiently intermingled to maintain linkage disequilibria between genetic incompatibilities, local-adaptation genes and neutral loci. Furthermore, the association between the locally adapted and intrinsically incompatible alleles (i.e. the sign of linkage disequilibrium between endogenous and exogenous loci) is arbitrary and can form in either direction. Reviewing results from the literature, we find that many predictions of our model are supported, including endogenous genetic barriers that coincide with environmental boundaries, local GEA in mosaic hybrid zones, and inverted or modified GEAs at distant locations. We argue that endogenous genetic barriers are often more likely than local adaptation to explain the majority of Fst-outlying loci observed in genome scan approaches \u2013 even when these are correlated to environmental variables.",

      "abstractNote": "We present here a stochastic two-locus, two-habitat model for the evolution of migration with local adaptation and kin selection. One locus determines the migration rate while the other causes local adaptation. We show that the opposing forces of kin competition and local adaptation can lead to the existence of one or two convergence stable migration rates, notably depending on the recombination rate between the two loci. We show that linkage between migration and local adaptation loci has two antagonist effects: when linkage is tight, cost of local adaptation increases, leading to smaller equilibrium migration rates. However, when linkage is tighter, the population structure at the migration locus tends to be very high because of the indirect selection, and thus equilibrium migration rates increases. This result, qualitatively different from results obtained with other models of migration evolution, indicates that ignoring drift or the detail of the genetic architecture may lead to incorrect conclusions.",

      "abstractNote": "By encompassing the whole continuum between allopatric and sympatric scenarios, parapatric speciation includes many potential scenarios for the evolution of new species. Here, we investigate how a genetic barrier to gene flow, that relies on a single postzygotic genetic incompatibility, may further evolve under ongoing migration. We consider a continent island model with three loci involved in pairwise Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs). Using an analytic approach, we derive the conditions for invasion of a new mutation and its consequences for the strength and stability of the initial genetic barrier. Our results show that the accumulation of genetic incompatibilities in the presence of gene flow is under strong selective constraints. In particular, preexisting incompatibilities do not always facilitate the invasion of further barrier genes. If new mutations do invade, they will often weaken or destroy the barrier rather than strengthening it. We conclude that migration is highly effective at disrupting the so-called \"snowball effect\", the accelerated accumulation of DMIs that has been described for allopatric populations en route to reproductive isolation.",

      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation experiments are widely used to quantify the levels of adaptation within a heterogeneous environment. However, theoretical studies generally focus on the probability of fixation of alleles or the mean fitness of populations, rather than local adaptation as it is commonly measured experimentally or in field studies. Here, we develop mathematical models and use them to generate analytical predictions for the level of local adaptation as a function of selection, migration and genetic drift. First, we contrast mean fitness and local adaptation measures and show that the latter can be expressed in a simple and general way as a function of the spatial covariance between population mean phenotype and local environmental conditions. Second, we develop several approximations of a population genetics model to show that the system exhibits different behaviours depending on the rate of migration. The main insights are the following: with intermediate migration, both genetic drift and migration decrease local adaptation; with low migration, drift decreases local adaptation but migration speeds up adaptation; with high migration, genetic drift has no effect on local adaptation. Third, we extend this analysis to cases where the trait under selection is continuous using classical quantitative genetics theory. Finally, we discuss these results in the light of recent experimental work on local adaptation.",

      "abstractNote": "Populations often experience variable conditions, both in time and space. Here we develop a novel theoretical framework to study the evolution of migration under the influence of spatially and temporally variable selection and genetic drift. First, we examine when polymorphism is maintained at a locus under heterogeneous selection, as a function of the pattern of spatial heterogeneity and the migration rate. In a second step, we study how levels of migration evolve under the joint action of kin competition and local adaptation at a polymorphic locus. This analysis reveals the existence of evolutionary bistability, whereby a low or a high migration rate may evolve depending on the initial conditions. Last, we relax several assumptions regarding selection heterogeneity commonly made in previous studies and explore the consequences of more complex spatial and temporal patterns of variability in selection on the evolution of migration. We found that small modifications in the pattern of environmental heterogeneity may have dramatic effects on the evolution of migration. This work highlights the importance of considering more general scenarios of environmental heterogeneity when studying the evolution of life-history traits in ecologically complex settings.",

      "abstractNote": "AbstractThe ability to migrate can evolve in response to various forces. In particular, when selection is heterogeneous in space but constant in time, local adaptation induces a fitness cost on immigrants and selects against migration. The evolutionary outcome, however, is less clear when selection also varies temporally. Here, we present a two-locus model analyzing the effects of spatial and temporal variability in selection on the evolution of migration. The first locus is under temporally varying selection (various periodic functions are considered, but a general nonparametric framework is used), and the second locus is a modifier controlling migration ability. First, we study the dynamics of local adaptation and derive the migration rate that maximizes local adaptation as a function of the speed and geometry of the fluctuations in the environment. Second, we derive an analytical expression for the evolutionarily stable migration rate. When there is no cost of migration, we show that higher migration rates are favored when selection changes fast. When migration is costly, however, the evolutionarily stable migration rate is maximal for an intermediate speed of the variation of selection. This model may help in understanding the evolution of migration in a broad range of scenarios and, in particular, in host-parasite systems, where selection is thought to vary quickly in both space and time.",

Here, we provide practical recommendations regarding (1) the definition of local adaptation, (2) the analysis of transplant experiments and (3) the optimisation of the experimental design of local adaptation studies.

      "abstractNote": "As climate changes, species\u2019 ability to spatially track suitable climate depends on their spread velocity, a function of their population growth and dispersal capacity. When climate changes faster than species can spread, the climate experienced at species\u2019 expanding range edges may ameliorate as conditions become increasingly similar to those of the range core. When this boosts species\u2019 growth rates, their spread accelerates. Here, we use simulations of a spreading population with an annual life history to explore how climatic amelioration interacts with dispersal evolution and local adaptation to determine the dynamics of spread. We found that depending on the timing of dispersal evolution, spread velocity can show contrasting trajectories, sometimes transiently exceeding the climate velocity before decelerating. Climatic amelioration can also accelerate the spread of populations composed of genotypes best adapted to local climatic conditions, but the exact dynamics depends on the pattern of climatic adaptation. We conclude that failing to account for demographic variation across climatic gradients can lead to erroneous conclusions about species\u2019 capacity to spatially track suitable climate.",

      "abstractNote": "Dispersal moves individuals from patches where their immediate ancestors were successful to sites where their genotypes are untested. As a result, dispersal generally reduces fitness, a phenomenon known as \u201cmigration load.\u201d The strength of migration load depends on the pattern of dispersal and can be dramatically lessened or reversed when individuals move preferentially toward patches conferring higher fitness. Evolutionary ecologists have long modeled nonrandom dispersal, focusing primarily on its effects on population density over space, the maintenance of genetic variation, and reproductive isolation. Here, we build upon previous work by calculating how the extent of local adaptation and the migration load are affected when individuals differ in their dispersal rate in a genotype-dependent manner that alters their match to their environment. Examining a one-locus, two-patch model, we show that local adaptation occurs through a combination of natural selection and adaptive dispersal. For a substantial portion of parameter space, adaptive dispersal can be the predominant force generating local adaptation. Furthermore, genetic load may be largely averted with adaptive dispersal whenever individuals move before selective deaths occur. Thus, to understand the mechanisms driving local adaptation, biologists must account for the extent and nature of nonrandom, genotype-dependent dispersal, and the potential for adaptation via spatial sorting of genotypes.",

      "title": "Detecting Selection in Population Trees: The Lewontin and Krakauer Test Extended",
      "abstractNote": "Detecting genetic signatures of selection is of great interest for many research issues. Common approaches to separate selective from neutral processes focus on the variance of FST across loci, as does the original Lewontin and Krakauer (LK) test. Modern developments aim to minimize the false positive rate and to increase the power, by accounting for complex demographic structures. Another stimulating goal is to develop straightforward parametric and computationally tractable tests to deal with massive SNP data sets. Here, we propose an extension of the original LK statistic (TLK), named TF\u2013LK, that uses a phylogenetic estimation of the population's kinship ($\\batchmode \\documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]{article} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\pagestyle{empty} \\begin{document} \\(\\mathrm{\\mathcal{F}}\\) \\end{document}$) matrix, thus accounting for historical branching and heterogeneity of genetic drift. Using forward simulations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data under neutrality and selection, we confirm the relative robustness of the LK statistic (TLK) to complex demographic history but we show that TF\u2013LK is more powerful in most cases. This new statistic outperforms also a multinomial-Dirichlet-based model [estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)], when historical branching occurs. Overall, TF\u2013LK detects 15\u201335% more selected SNPs than TLK for low type I errors (P &lt; 0.001). Also, simulations show that TLK and TF\u2013LK follow a chi-square distribution provided the ancestral allele frequencies are not too extreme, suggesting the possible use of the chi-square distribution for evaluating significance. The empirical distribution of TF\u2013LK can be derived using simulations conditioned on the estimated $\\batchmode \\documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]{article} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\pagestyle{empty} \\begin{document} \\(\\mathrm{\\mathcal{F}}\\) \\end{document}$ matrix. We apply this new test to pig breeds SNP data and pinpoint outliers using TF\u2013LK, otherwise undetected using the less powerful TLK statistic. This new test represents one solution for compromise between advanced SNP genetic data acquisition and outlier analyses.",

      "abstractNote": "Body condition-dependent dispersal strategies are common in nature. Although it is obvious that environmental constraints may induce a positive relationship between body condition and dispersal, it is not clear whether positive body conditional dispersal strategies may evolve as a strategy in metapopulations. We have developed an individual-based simulation model to investigate how body condition-dispersal reaction norms evolve in metapopulations that are characterized by different levels of environmental stochasticity and dispersal mortality. In the model, body condition is related to fecundity and determined either by environmental conditions during juvenile development (adult dispersal) or by those experienced by the mother (natal dispersal). Evolutionarily stable reaction norms strongly depend on metapopulation conditions: positive body condition dependency of dispersal evolved in metapopulation conditions with low levels of dispersal mortality and high levels of environmental stochasticity. Negative body condition-dependent dispersal evolved in metapopulations with high dispersal mortality and low environmental stochasticity. The latter strategy is responsible for higher dispersal rates under kin competition when dispersal decisions are based on body condition reached at the adult life stage. The evolution of both positive and negative body condition-dependent dispersal strategies is consequently likely in metapopulations and depends on the prevalent environmental conditions.",

      "abstractNote": "Environmental heterogeneity can lead to spatially varying selection, which can, in turn, lead to local adaptation. Long-held views in evolutionary biology predict that environmental heterogeneity that is spatially autocorrelated will lead to stronger local adaptation than if it is not. Here I test this explicitly, combining analysis of a dataset from a large-scale provenance trial conducted on lodgepole pine with simulations modelling local adaptation. I find evidence that environmental heterogeneity that is spatially autocorrelated leads to stronger local adaptation in natural populations. Using simulations, I examine how the genetics of local adaptation are influenced by the spatial pattern of environmental heterogeneity. The simulations confirm that local adaptation increases with the degree of spatial autocorrelation in the selective environment, but also show that highly heterogeneous environments are more likely to exhibit high variation in local adaptation, a result not previously described. Spatial autocorrelation in the environment influences the genetic architecture of local adaptation, with different patterns of allele frequency and effect size arising under different patterns of environmental variation. These differences will likely impact the ability to study the genetic basis of local adaptation. Overall, this work emphasizes the profound importance that the spatial pattern of selection can have on the evolution and how spatial autocorrelation should be considered in ecological and genetic studies of local adaptation.",

      "abstractNote": "The ecological niche and mate preferences have independently been shown to be important for the process of speciation. Here, we articulate a novel mechanism by which ecological niche use and mate preference can be linked to promote speciation. The degree to which individual niches are narrow and clustered affects the strength of divergent natural selection and population splitting. Similarly, the degree to which individual mate preferences are narrow and clustered affects the strength of divergent sexual selection and assortative mating between diverging forms. This novel perspective is inspired by the literature on ecological niches; it also explores mate preferences and how they may contribute to speciation. Unlike much comparative work, we do not search for evolutionary patterns using proxies for adaptation and sexual selection, but rather we elucidate how ideas from niche theory relate to mate preference, and how this relationship can foster speciation. Recognizing that individual and population niches are conceptually and ecologically linked to individual and population mate preference functions will significantly increase our understanding of rapid evolutionary diversification in nature. It has potential to help solve the difficult challenge of testing the role of sexual selection in the speciation process. We also identify ecological factors that are likely to affect individual niche and individual mate preference in synergistic ways and as a consequence to promote speciation. The ecological niche an individual occupies can directly affect its mate preference. Clusters of individuals with narrow, differentiated niches are likely to have narrow, differentiated mate preference functions. Our approach integrates ecological and sexual selection research to further our understanding of diversification processes. Such integration may be necessary for progress because these processes seem inextricably linked in the natural world.",

      "abstractNote": "The evolutionary potential of populations is mainly determined by population size and available genetic variance. However, the adaptability of spatially structured populations may also be affected by dispersal: positively by spreading beneficial mutations across sub-populations, but negatively by moving locally adapted alleles between demes. We develop an individual-based, two-patch, allelic model to investigate the balance between these opposing effects on a population's evolutionary response to rapid climate change. Individual fitness is controlled by two polygenic traits coding for local adaptation either to the environment or to climate. Under conditions of selection that favour the evolution of a generalist phenotype (i.e. weak divergent selection between patches) dispersal has an overall positive effect on the persistence of the population. However, when selection favours locally adapted specialists, the beneficial effects of dispersal outweigh the associated increase in maladaptation for a narrow range of parameter space only (intermediate selection strength and low linkage among loci), where the spread of beneficial climate alleles is not strongly hampered by selection against non-specialists. Given that local selection across heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes is common, the complex effect of dispersal that we describe will play an important role in determining the evolutionary dynamics of many species under rapidly changing climate.",

Recent models addressing this problem have brought together population genetics and population ecology, and some have included interactions among species at range edges. Here, we review these models of adaptation at environmental or parapatric margins, and discuss the contrasting effects of migration in either swamping local adaptation, or supplying the genetic variation that is necessary for adaptation to continue. We illustrate how studying adaptation at range margins (both with and without hybridization) can provide insight into the genetic and ecological factors that limit evolution more generally, especially in response to current rates of environmental change.",

      "title": "Local adaptation stops where ecological gradients steepen or are interrupted",
      "abstractNote": "Population genetic models of evolution along linear environmental gradients cannot explain why adaptation stops at ecological margins. This is because, unless models impose reductions in carrying capacity at species\u2019 edges, the dominant effect of gene flow is to increase genetic variance and adaptive potential rather than swamping local adaptation. This allows the population to match even very steep changes in trait optima. We extend our previous simulations to explore two nonlinear models of ecological gradients: (a) a sigmoid (steepening) gradient and (b) a linear gradient with a flat centre of variable width. We compare the parameter conditions that allow local adaptation and range expansion from the centre, with those that permit the persistence of a perfectly adapted population distributed across the entire range. Along nonlinear gradients, colonization is easier, and extinction rarer, than along a linear gradient. This is because the shallow environmental gradient near the range centre does not cause gene flow to increase genetic variation, and so does not result in reduced population density. However, as gradient steepness increases, gene flow inflates genetic variance and reduces local population density sufficiently that genetic drift overcomes local selection, creating a finite range margin. When a flat centre is superimposed on a linear gradient, gene flow increases genetic variation dramatically at its edges, leading to an abrupt reduction in density that prevents niche expansion. Remarkably local interruptions in a linear ecological gradient (of a width much less than the mean dispersal distance) can prevent local adaptation beyond this flat centre. In contrast to other situations, this effect is stronger and more consistent where carrying capacity is high. Practically speaking, this means that habitat improvement at patch margins will make evolutionary rescue more likely. By contrast, even small improvements in habitat at patch centres may confine populations to limited areas of ecological space.",

      "title": "Understanding the biology of species' ranges: when and how does evolution change the rules of ecological engagement?",
      "abstractNote": "Understanding processes that limit species' ranges has been a core issue in ecology and evolutionary biology for many decades, and has become increasingly important given the need to predict the responses of biological communities to rapid environmental change. However, we still have a poor understanding of evolution at range limits and its capacity to change the ecological \u2018rules of engagement\u2019 that define these communities, as well as the time frame over which this occurs. Here we link papers in the current volume to some key concepts involved in the interactions between evolutionary and ecological processes at species' margins. In particular, we separate hypotheses about species\u2019 margins that focus on hard evolutionary limits, which determine how genotypes interact with their environment, from those concerned with soft evolutionary limits, which determine where and when local adaptation can persist in space and time. We show how theoretical models and empirical studies highlight conditions under which gene flow can expand local limits as well as contain them. In doing so, we emphasize the complex interplay between selection, demography and population structure throughout a species' geographical and ecological range that determines its persistence in biological communities. However, despite some impressively detailed studies on range limits, particularly in invertebrates and plants, few generalizations have emerged that can predict evolutionary responses at ecological margins. We outline some directions for future work such as considering the impact of structural genetic variants and metapopulation structure on limits, and the interaction between range limits and the evolution of mating systems and non-random dispersal.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue \u2018Species\u2019 ranges in the face of changing environments (Part II)\u2019.",

      "title": "Why is adaptation prevented at ecological margins? New insights from individual-based simulations",
      "abstractNote": "All species are restricted in their distribution. Currently, ecological models can only explain such limits if patches vary in quality, leading to asymmetrical dispersal, or if genetic variation is too low at the margins for adaptation. However, population genetic models suggest that the increase in genetic variance resulting from dispersal should allow adaptation to almost any ecological gradient. Clearly therefore, these models miss something that prevents evolution in natural populations. We developed an individual-based simulation to explore stochastic effects in these models. At high carrying capacities, our simulations largely agree with deterministic predictions. However, when carrying capacity is low, the population fails to establish for a wide range of parameter values where adaptation was expected from previous models. Stochastic or transient effects appear critical around the boundaries in parameter space between simulation behaviours. Dispersal, gradient steepness, and population density emerge as key factors determining adaptation on an ecological gradient.",

      "abstractNote": "Richard Levins introduced fitness sets as a tool for investigating evolution within heterogeneous environments. Evolutionary game theory permits a synthesis and generalization of this approach by considering the evolutionary response of organisms to any scale of habitat heterogeneity. As scales of heterogeneity increase from fine to coarse, the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) switches from a single generalist species to several species that become increasingly specialized on distinct habitats. Depending upon the organisms' ecology, the switch from one to two species may occur at high migration rates (relatively fine-grained environment), or may only occur at very low migration rates (coarse-grained environment). At the ESS, the evolutionary context of a species is the entire landscape, while its ecological context may be a single habitat.",

      "abstractNote": "The literature has regarded migration as both an ecological phenomenon (the mere movement of individuals from one area to another) and a genetic phenomenon (i.e., dispersal, the mixing of individuals between demes or subpopulations). For example, the seasonal movement of birds between a breeding ground and an overwintering ground constitutes ecological migration, whereas the movement of an individual between breeding grounds is genetic migration. Ecological migration does not influence population structure (by definition), and natural selection therefore acts on ecological migration in a simple manner: the migratory habits yielding the highest fecundity are favored. Genetic migration influences population structure, however, and its evolution is not as simple. A model of genetic migration is studied and reveals that genetic migration is selected according to the geometric mean fitness of movements that constitute a \"loop,\" involving gene flow away from and ultimately back to a deme. Since the natural selection of genetic migration is coupled to the fitnesses of multiple movements in a loop, the fitness of any component migration within such a loop may be high or low and cannot itself indicate the nature of selection for that component of migration. The present results are discussed in the context of previous results concerning the evolution of genetic migration.",

      "abstractNote": "It has been shown theoretically that sympatric speciation can occur if intraspecific competition is strong enough to induce disruptive selection. However, the plausibility of the involved processes is under debate, and many questions on the conditions for speciation remain unresolved. For instance, is strong disruptive selection sufficient for speciation? Which roles do genetic architecture and initial composition of the population play? How strong must assortative mating be before a population can split in two? These are some of the issues we address here. We investigate a diploid multilocus model of a quantitative trait that is under frequency-dependent selection caused by a balance of intraspecific competition and frequency-independent stabilizing selection. This trait also acts as mating character for assortment. It has been established previously that speciation can occur only if competition is strong enough to induce disruptive selection. We find that speciation becomes more difficult for very strong competition, because then extremely strong assortment is required. Thus, speciation is most likely for intermediate strengths of competition, where it requires strong, but not extremely strong, assortment. For this range of parameters, however, it is not obvious how assortment can evolve from low to high levels, because with moderately strong assortment less genetic variation is maintained than under weak or strong assortment-sometimes none at all. In addition to the strength of frequency-dependent competition and assortative mating, the roles of the number of loci, the distribution of allelic effects, the initial conditions, costs to being choosy, the strength of stabilizing selection, and the particular choice of the fitness function are explored. A multitude of possible evolutionary outcomes is observed, including loss of all genetic variation, splitting in two to five species, as well as very short and extremely long stable limit cycles. On the methodological side, we propose quantitative measures for deciding whether a given distribution reflects two (or more) reproductively isolated clusters.",

      "abstractNote": "Population subdivision and migration are generally considered to be important causes of linkage disequilibrium (LD). We explore the combined effects of recombination and gene flow on the amount of LD, the maintenance of polymorphism, and the degree of local adaptation in a subdivided population by analyzing a diploid, deterministic continent\u2013island model with genic selection on two linked loci (i.e., no dominance or epistasis). For this simple model, we characterize explicitly all possible equilibrium configurations. Simple and intuitive approximations for many quantities of interest are obtained in limiting cases, such as weak migration, weak selection, weak or strong recombination. For instance, we derive explicit expressions for the measures D(=pAB\u2212pApB) and r2 (the squared correlation in allelic state) of LD. They depend in qualitatively different ways on the migration rate. Remarkably high values of r2 are maintained between weakly linked loci, especially if gene flow is low. We determine how the maximum amount of gene flow that admits preservation of the locally adapted haplotype, hence of polymorphism at both loci, depends on recombination rate and selection coefficients. We also investigate the evolution of differentiation by examining the invasion of beneficial mutants of small effect that are linked to an already present, locally adapted allele. Mutants of much smaller effect can invade successfully than predicted by naive single-locus theory provided they are at least weakly linked. Finally, the influence of linkage on the degree of local adaptation, the migration load, and the effective migration rate at a neutral locus is explored. We discuss possible consequences for the evolution of genetic architecture, in particular, for the emergence of clusters of tightly linked, slightly beneficial mutations and the evolution of recombination and chromosome inversions.",

      "title": "Evolution and polymorphism in the multilocus Levene model with no or weak epistasis",
      "abstractNote": "Evolution and the maintenance of polymorphism under the multilocus Levene model with soft selection are studied. The number of loci and alleles, the number of demes, the linkage map, and the degree of dominance are arbitrary, but epistasis is absent or weak. We prove that, without epistasis and under mild, generic conditions, every trajectory converges to a stationary point in linkage equilibrium. Consequently, the equilibrium and stability structure can be determined by investigating the much simpler gene-frequency dynamics on the linkage-equilibrium manifold. For a haploid species an analogous result is shown. For weak epistasis, global convergence to quasi-linkage equilibrium is established. As an application, the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism is explored if the degree of dominance is intermediate at every locus and epistasis is absent or weak. If there are at least two demes, then arbitrarily many multiallelic loci can be maintained polymorphic at a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. Because this holds for an open set of parameters, such equilibria are structurally stable. If the degree of dominance is not only intermediate but also deme independent, and loci are diallelic, an open set of parameters yielding an internal equilibrium exists only if the number of loci is strictly less than the number of demes. Otherwise, a fully polymorphic equilibrium exists only nongenerically, and if it exists, it consists of a manifold of equilibria. Its dimension is determined. In the absence of genotype-by-environment interaction, however, a manifold of equilibria occurs for an open set of parameters. In this case, the equilibrium structure is not robust to small deviations from no genotype-by-environment interaction. In a quantitative-genetic setting, the assumptions of no epistasis and intermediate dominance are equivalent to assuming that in every deme directional selection acts on a trait that is determined additively, i.e.,\u00a0by nonepistatic loci with dominance. Some of our results are exemplified in this quantitative-genetic context.",

      "abstractNote": "We study a class of genetic models in which a quantitative trait determined by several additive loci is subject to temporally fluctuating selection. Selection on the trait is assumed to be stabilizing but with an optimum that varies periodically and might be perturbed stochastically. The population mates at random, is infinitely large and has discrete generations. We pursue a statistical and numerical approach, covering a wide range of ecological and genetic parameters, to determine the potential of fluctuating environments to maintain quantitative genetic variation. Whereas, in contrast to some recent claims, this potential seems to be rather limited in the absence of recurrent mutation, fluctuating environments might, in combination with it, often generate high levels of additive genetic variation. We investigate how the genetic variation maintained depends on the ecological parameters and on the underlying genetics.",

      "abstractNote": "The joint effects of stabilizing selection, mutation, recombination, and random drift on the genetic variability of a polygenic character in a finite population are investigated. A simulation study is performed to test the validity of various analytical predictions on the equilibrium genetic variance. A new formula for the expected equilibrium variance is derived that approximates the observed equilibrium variance very closely for all parameter combinations we have tested. The computer model simulates the continuum-of-alleles model of Crow and Kimura. However, it is completely stochastic in the sense that it models evolution as a Markov process and does not use any deterministic evolution equations. The theoretical results are compared with heritability estimates from laboratory and natural populations. Heritabilities ranging from 20% to 50%, as observed even in lab populations under a constant environment, can only be explained by a mutation-selection balance if the phenotypic character is neutral or the number of genes contributing to the trait is sufficiently high, typically several hundred, or if there are a few highly variable loci that influence quantitative traits.",

      "abstractNote": "Ecologically driven sympatric speciation has received much attention recently. We investigate a multilocus model of a quantitative trait that is under frequency\u2010dependent selection caused by intraspecific competition and acts as mating character for assortment. We identify the conditions that lead to the establishment of reproductively isolated clusters. This may be interpreted as evolutionary splitting or sympatric speciation. In our model, there are parameters that independently determine the strength of assortment, the costs for being choosy, and the strength of frequency\u2010dependent natural selection. Sufficiently strong frequency dependence leads to disruptive selection on the phenotypes. The population consists of (sexual) haploid individuals. If frequency dependence is strong enough to induce disruptive selection and costs are absent or low, the result of evolution depends in a distinctive nonlinear way on the strength of assortment: under moderately strong assortment, less genetic variation is maintained than under weak or strong assortment, and sometimes there is none at all. Evolutionary splitting occurs only if frequency dependence and assortment are both strong enough and costs are low. Even then, the evolutionary outcome depends on the genetics and the initial conditions. The roles of the number of loci, of linkage, and of asymmetric selection are also explored.",

      "abstractNote": "The potential of maintaining multilocus polymorphism by migration-selection balance is studied. A large population of diploid individuals is distributed over finitely many demes connected by migration. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping, selection may vary across demes, and loci are multiallelic. It is shown that if migration and recombination are strong relative to selection, then with weak or no epistasis and intermediate dominance at every locus and in every deme, arbitrarily many alleles can be maintained at arbitrarily many loci at a stable equilibrium. If migration is weak relative to selection and recombination, then with weak or no epistasis and intermediate dominance at every locus and in every deme, as many alleles as there are demes can be maintained at arbitrarily many loci at equilibrium. In both cases open sets of such parameter combinations are constructed, thus the results are robust with respect to small, but arbitrary, perturbations in the parameters. For weak migration, the number of demes is, in fact, a generic upper bound to the number of alleles that can be maintained at any locus. Thus, several scenarios are identified under which multilocus polymorphism can be maintained by migration-selection balance when this is impossible in a panmictic population.",

      "abstractNote": "This survey focuses on the most important aspects of the mathematical theory of population genetic models of selection and migration between discrete niches. Such models are most appropriate if the dispersal distance is short compared to the scale at which the environment changes, or if the habitat is fragmented. The general goal of such models is to study the influence of population subdivision and gene flow among subpopulations on the amount and pattern of genetic variation maintained. Only deterministic models are treated. Because space is discrete, they are formulated in terms of systems of nonlinear difference or differential equations. A central topic is the exploration of the equilibrium and stability structure under various assumptions on the patterns of selection and migration. Another important, closely related topic concerns conditions (necessary or sufficient) for fully polymorphic (internal) equilibria. First, the theory of one-locus models with two or multiple alleles is laid out. Then, mostly very recent, developments about multilocus models are presented. Finally, as an application, analysis and results of an explicit two-locus model emerging from speciation theory are highlighted.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent work incorporating demographic\u2013genetic interactions indicates the importance of population size, gene flow, and selection in influencing local adaptation. This work typically assumes that density-dependent survival affects individuals equally, but individuals in natural population rarely compete equally. Among-individual differences in resource use generate stronger competition between more similar phenotypes (frequency-dependent competition) but it remains unclear how this additional form of selection changes the interactions between population size, gene flow, and local stabilizing selection. Here, we integrate migration\u2013selection dynamics with frequency-dependent competition. We developed a coupled demographic-quantitative genetic model consisting of two patches connected by dispersal and subject to local stabilizing selection and competition. Our model shows that frequency-dependent competition slightly increases local adaptation, greatly increases genetic variance within patches, and reduces the amount that migration depresses population size, despite the increased genetic variance load. The effects of frequency-dependence depend on the strength of divergent selection, trait heritability, and when mortality occurs in the life cycle in relation to migration and reproduction. Essentially, frequency-dependent competition reduces the density-dependent interactions between migrants and residents, the extent to which depends on how different and common immigrants are compared to residents. Our results add new dynamics that illustrate how competition can alter the effects of gene flow and divergent selection on local adaptation and population carrying capacities.",

      "abstractNote": "Signals of local adaptation have been found in many plants and animals, highlighting the heterogeneity in the distribution of adaptive genetic variation throughout species ranges. In the coming decades, global climate change is expected to induce shifts in the selective pressures that shape this adaptive variation. These changes in selective pressures will likely result in varying degrees of local climate maladaptation and spatial reshuffling of the underlying distributions of adaptive alleles. There is a growing interest in using population genomic data to help predict future disruptions to locally adaptive gene-environment associations. One motivation behind such work is to better understand how the effects of changing climate on populations\u2019 short-term fitness could vary spatially across species ranges. Here we review the current use of genomic data to predict the disruption of local adaptation across current and future climates. After assessing goals and motivationsunderlying the approach, we review the main steps and associated statistical methods currently in use and explore our current understanding of the limits and future potential of using genomics to predict climate change (mal)adaptation.",

      "abstractNote": "Darwin viewed species range limits as chiefly determined by an interplay between the abiotic environment and interspecific interactions. Haldane argued that species' ranges could be set intraspecifically when gene flow from a species\u2019 populous center overwhelms local adaptation at the periphery. Recently, Kirkpatrick and Barton have modeled Haldane\u2019s process with a quantitative genetic model that combines density\u2010dependent local population growth with dispersal and gene flow across a linear environmental gradient in optimum phenotype. To address Darwin\u2019s ideas, we have extended the Kirkpatrick and Barton model to include interspecific competition and the frequency\u2010dependent selection that it generates, as well as stabilizing selection on a quantitative character. Our model includes local population growth, movements over space, natural selection, and gene flow. It simultaneously addresses the evolution of character displacement and species borders. It reproduces the Kirkpatrick and Barton single\u2010species result that limited ranges can be produced with sufficiently steep environmental gradients and strong dispersal. Further, in the absence of environmental gradients or barriers to dispersal, interspecific competition will not limit species ranges at evolutionary equilibrium. However, interspecific competition can interact with environmental gradients and gene flow to generate limited ranges with much less extreme gradient and dispersal parameters than in the single\u2010species case. Species display character displacement in sympatry, yet the reduction in competition that results from this displacement does not necessarily allow the two species to become sympatric everywhere. When species meet, competition reduces population densities in the region of overlap, which, in turn, intensifies the asymmetry in gene flow from center to margin. This reduces the ability of each species to adapt to local physical conditions at their range limits. If environmental gradients are monotonic but not linear, the transition zone between species at coevolutionary equilibrium occurs where the environmental gradient is steepest. If productivity gradients are also introduced into the model, then patterns similar to Rapoport\u2019s rule emerge. Interacting species respond to climate change, as it affects the optimal phenotype over space, by a combination of range shifts and local evolution in mean phenotype, while solitary species respond solely by range shifts. Finally, we compare empirical estimates for intrinsic growth rates and diffusion coefficients for several species to those needed by the single\u2010species model to produce a stable limited range. These empirical values are generally insufficient to produce limited ranges in the model suggesting a role for interspecific interactions.",

      "abstractNote": "The distribution of resources in space has important consequences for the evolution of dispersal-related traits. Dispersal moderates patterns of gene flow and, consequently, the potential for local adaptation to spatially differentiated resource types. We lack both models and experiments that evaluate how dispersal evolves in landscapes with multiple resources. Here, we investigate the evolution of dispersal in landscapes that contain two resource types that differ in their spatial autocorrelations. Individuals may possess ecological traits that give them a fitness advantage on one or the other resource. We find that resources differing in their spatial autocorrelation select for different optimal dispersal strategies and, further, that some multi-resource landscapes can support the stable coexistence of distinct dispersal strategies. Whether divergence in dispersal strategies between resource specialists occurs depends on the underlying structure of the resources and the degree of linkage between dispersal strategies and ecological specialization. This work indicates that the spatial autocorrelation of resources is an important factor in determining when evolutionary branching is likely to occur, and sheds light on when secondary isolating mechanisms should arise between locally adapted specialists.",

      "abstractNote": "The interplay between space and evolution is an important issue in population dynamics, that is particularly crucial in the emergence of polymorphism and spatial patterns. Recently, biological studies suggest that invasion and evolution are closely related. Here, we model the interplay between space and evolution starting with an individual-based approach and show the important role of parameter scalings on clustering and invasion. We consider a stochastic discrete model with birth, death, competition, mutation and spatial diffusion, where all the parameters may depend both on the position and on the phenotypic trait of individuals. The spatial motion is driven by a reflected diffusion in a bounded domain. The interaction is modelled as a trait competition between individuals within a given spatial interaction range. First, we give an algorithmic construction of the process. Next, we obtain large population approximations, as weak solutions of nonlinear reaction\u2013diffusion equations. As the spatial interaction range is fixed, the nonlinearity is nonlocal. Then, we make the interaction range decrease to zero and prove the convergence to spatially localized nonlinear reaction\u2013diffusion equations. Finally, a discussion of three concrete examples is proposed, based on simulations of the microscopic individual-based model. These examples illustrate the strong effects of the spatial interaction range on the emergence of spatial and phenotypic diversity (clustering and polymorphism) and on the interplay between invasion and evolution. The simulations focus on the qualitative differences between local and nonlocal interactions.",

We show that this causes higher plasticity to evolve on the island than on the continent at migration-selection equilibrium, assuming genetic variation of reaction norms is such that phenotypic variance is higher on the island, where phenotypes are not canalized. For a species distributed continuously in space along an environmental gradient, higher plasticity evolves at the edges of the geographic range, and in environments where phenotypes are not canalized. Constant or evolving partially adaptive plasticity also alleviates maladaptation owing to gene flow in a heterogeneous environment and produces higher mean fitness and larger population size in marginal populations, preventing them from becoming sinks and facilitating invasion of new habitats. Our results shed light on the widely observed involvement of partially adaptive plasticity in phenotypic clines, and on the mechanisms causing geographic variation in plasticity.",

      "abstractNote": "Niche dimensionality is suggested to be a key determinant of ecological speciation (\"multifarious selection\" hypothesis), but genetic aspects of this process have not been investigated theoretically. We use Fisher's geometrical model to study how niche dimensionality influences the mean fitness of hybrids formed upon secondary contact between populations adapting in allopatry. Gaussian selection for an optimum generates two forms of reproductive isolation (RI): an extrinsic component due to maladaptation of the mean phenotype, and an intrinsic variance load resulting from what we term transgressive incompatibilities between mutations fixed in different populations. We show that after adaptation to a new environment, RI increases with (1) the mean initial maladaptation of diverging population, and (2) niche dimensionality, which increases the phenotypic variability of fixed mutations. Under mutation selection drift equilibrium in a constant environment, RI accumulates steadily with time, at a rate that also increases with niche dimensionality. A similar pattern can be produced by successive shifts in the optimum phenotype. Niche dimensionality thus has an effect per se on postzygotic isolation, beyond putative indirect effects (stronger selection, more genes). Our mechanism is consistent with empirical evidence about transgressive segregation in crosses between divergent populations, and with patterns of accumulation of RI with time in many taxa.",

      "title": "Subdivided populations: A review of the one- and two-locus deterministic theory",
      "abstractNote": "The existence, uniqueness, and shape of clines in a quantitative trait under selection toward a spatially varying optimum is studied. The focus is on deterministic diploid two-locus n<math><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></math>-deme models subject to various migration patterns and selection scenarios. Migration patterns may exhibit isolation by distance, as in the stepping-stone model, or random dispersal, as in the island model. The phenotypic optimum may change abruptly in a single environmental step, more gradually, or not at all. Symmetry assumptions are imposed on phenotypic optima and migration rates. We study clines in the mean, variance, and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Clines result from polymorphic equilibria. The possible equilibrium configurations are determined as functions of the migration rate. Whereas for weak migration, many polymorphic equilibria may be simultaneously stable, their number decreases with increasing migration rate. Also for intermediate migration rates polymorphic equilibria are in general not unique, however, for loci of equal effects the corresponding clines in the mean, variance, and LD are unique. For sufficiently strong migration, no polymorphism is maintained. Both migration pattern and selection scenario exert strong influence on the existence and shape of clines. The results for discrete demes are compared with those from models in which space varies continuously and dispersal is modeled by diffusion. Comparisons with previous studies, which investigated clines under neutrality or under linkage equilibrium, are performed. If there is no long-distance migration, the environment does not change abruptly, and linkage is not very tight, populations are almost everywhere close to linkage equilibrium.\nThe consequences of spatially varying, stabilizing or directional selection on a quantitative trait in a subdivided population are studied. A deterministic two-locus two-deme model is employed to explore the effects of migration, the degree of divergent selection, and the genetic architecture, i.e., the recombination rate and ratio of locus effects, on the maintenance of genetic variation. The possible equilibrium configurations are determined as functions of the migration rate. They depend crucially on the strength of divergent selection and the genetic architecture. The maximum migration rates are investigated below which a stable fully polymorphic equilibrium or a stable single-locus polymorphism can exist. Under stabilizing selection, but with different optima in the demes, strong recombination may facilitate the maintenance of polymorphism. However usually, and in particular with directional selection in opposite direction, the critical migration rates are maximized by a concentrated genetic architecture, i.e., by a major locus and a tightly linked minor one. Thus, complementing previous work on the evolution of genetic architectures in subdivided populations subject to diversifying selection, it is shown that concentrated architectures may aid the maintenance of polymorphism. Conditions are obtained when this is the case. Finally, the dependence of the phenotypic variance, linkage disequilibrium, and various measures of local adaptation and differentiation on the parameters is elaborated.\nPopulation subdivision and migration are generally considered to be important causes of linkage disequilibrium (LD). We explore the combined effects of recombination and gene flow on the amount of LD, the maintenance of polymorphism, and the degree of local adaptation in a subdivided population by analyzing a diploid, deterministic continent\u2013island model with genic selection on two linked loci (i.e., no dominance or epistasis). For this simple model, we characterize explicitly all possible equilibrium configurations. Simple and intuitive approximations for many quantities of interest are obtained in limiting cases, such as weak migration, weak selection, weak or strong recombination. For instance, we derive explicit expressions for the measures D(=pAB\u2212pApB)<math><mi is=\"true\">D</mi><mspace class=\"nbsp\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">(</mo><mo is=\"true\">=</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">p</mi></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">B</mi></mrow></msub><mo is=\"true\">\u2212</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">p</mi></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi></mrow></msub><msub is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">p</mi></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">B</mi></mrow></msub><mo is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></math> and r2<math><msup is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">r</mi></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><mn is=\"true\">2</mn></mrow></msup></math> (the squared correlation in allelic state) of LD. They depend in qualitatively different ways on the migration rate. Remarkably high values of r2<math><msup is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">r</mi></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><mn is=\"true\">2</mn></mrow></msup></math> are maintained between weakly linked loci, especially if gene flow is low. We determine how the maximum amount of gene flow that admits preservation of the locally adapted haplotype, hence of polymorphism at both loci, depends on recombination rate and selection coefficients. We also investigate the evolution of differentiation by examining the invasion of beneficial mutants of small effect that are linked to an already present, locally adapted allele. Mutants of much smaller effect can invade successfully than predicted by naive single-locus theory provided they are at least weakly linked. Finally, the influence of linkage on the degree of local adaptation, the migration load, and the effective migration rate at a neutral locus is explored. We discuss possible consequences for the evolution of genetic architecture, in particular, for the emergence of clusters of tightly linked, slightly beneficial mutations and the evolution of recombination and chromosome inversions.\nEvolution and the maintenance of polymorphism under the multilocus Levene model with soft selection are studied. The number of loci and alleles, the number of demes, the linkage map, and the degree of dominance are arbitrary, but epistasis is absent or weak. We prove that, without epistasis and under mild, generic conditions, every trajectory converges to a stationary point in linkage equilibrium. Consequently, the equilibrium and stability structure can be determined by investigating the much simpler gene-frequency dynamics on the linkage-equilibrium manifold. For a haploid species an analogous result is shown. For weak epistasis, global convergence to quasi-linkage equilibrium is established. As an application, the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism is explored if the degree of dominance is intermediate at every locus and epistasis is absent or weak. If there are at least two demes, then arbitrarily many multiallelic loci can be maintained polymorphic at a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. Because this holds for an open set of parameters, such equilibria are structurally stable. If the degree of dominance is not only intermediate but also deme independent, and loci are diallelic, an open set of parameters yielding an internal equilibrium exists only if the number of loci is strictly less than the number of demes. Otherwise, a fully polymorphic equilibrium exists only nongenerically, and if it exists, it consists of a manifold of equilibria. Its dimension is determined. In the absence of genotype-by-environment interaction, however, a manifold of equilibria occurs for an open set of parameters. In this case, the equilibrium structure is not robust to small deviations from no genotype-by-environment interaction. In a quantitative-genetic setting, the assumptions of no epistasis and intermediate dominance are equivalent to assuming that in every deme directional selection acts on a trait that is determined additively, i.e., by nonepistatic loci with dominance. Some of our results are exemplified in this quantitative-genetic context.\nThe maintenance of genetic variation in a spatially heterogeneous environment has been one of the main research themes in theoretical population genetics. Despite considerable progress in understanding the consequences of spatially structured environments on genetic variation, many problems remain unsolved. One of them concerns the relationship between the number of demes, the degree of dominance, and the maximum number of alleles that can be maintained by selection in a subdivided population. In this work, we study the potential of maintaining genetic variation in a two-deme model with deme-independent degree of intermediate dominance, which includes absence of G\u00d7E interaction as a special case. We present a thorough numerical analysis of a two-deme three-allele model, which allows us to identify dominance and selection patterns that harbor the potential for stable triallelic equilibria. The information gained by this approach is then used to construct an example in which existence and asymptotic stability of a fully polymorphic equilibrium can be proved analytically. Noteworthy, in this example the parameter range in which three alleles can coexist is maximized for intermediate migration rates. Our results can be interpreted in a specialist\u2013generalist context and (among others) show when two specialists can coexist with a generalist in two demes if the degree of dominance is deme independent and intermediate. The dominance relation between the generalist allele and the specialist alleles play a decisive role. We also discuss linear selection on a quantitative trait and show that G\u00d7E interaction is not necessary for the maintenance of more than two alleles in two demes.",

      "abstractNote": "Striking examples of local adaptation at fine geographic scales are increasingly being documented in natural populations. However, the relative contributions made by natural selection, phenotype-dependent dispersal (when individuals disperse with respect to a habitat preference), and mate preference in generating and maintaining microgeographic adaptation and divergence are not well studied. Here, we develop quantitative genetics models and individual-based simulations (IBSs) to uncover the evolutionary forces that possibly drive microgeographic divergence. We also perform Bayesian estimation of the parameters in our IBS using empirical data on habitat-specific variation in bill morphology in the island scrub-jay (Aphelocoma insularis) to apply our models to a natural system. We find that natural selection and phenotype-dependent dispersal can generate the patterns of divergence we observe in the island scrub-jay. However, mate preference for a mate with similar bill morphology, even though observed in the species, does not play a significant role in driving divergence. Our modeling approach provides insights into phenotypic evolution occurring over small spatial scales relative to dispersal ranges, suggesting that adaptive divergence at microgeographic scales may be common across a wider range of taxa than previously thought. Our quantitative genetic models help to inform future theoretical and empirical work to determine how selection, habitat preference, and mate preference contribute to local adaptation and microgeographic divergence.",

      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation and sexual dimorphism are iconic evolutionary scenarios of intraspecific adaptive differentiation in the face of gene flow. Although theory has traditionally considered local adaptation and sexual dimorphism as conceptually distinct processes, emerging data suggest that they often act concurrently during evolutionary diversification. Here, I merge theories of local adaptation in space and sex-specific adaptation over time, and show that their confluence yields several new predictions about the roles of context-specific selection, migration, and genetic correlations, in adaptive diversification. I specifically revisit two influential predictions from classical studies of clinal adaptation and sexual dimorphism: (1) that local adaptation should decrease with distance from the species\u2019 range center and (2) that opposing directional selection between the sexes (sexual antagonism) should inevitably accompany the evolution of sexual dimorphism. I show that both predictions can break down under clinally varying selection. First, the geography of local adaptation can be sexually dimorphic, with locations of relatively high local adaptation differing profoundly between the sexes. Second, the intensity of sexual antagonism varies across the species\u2019 range, with subpopulations near the range center representing hotspots for antagonistic selection. The results highlight the context-dependent roles of migration versus sexual conflict as primary constraints to adaptive diversification.",

      "abstractNote": "Many conspicuous forms of evolutionary diversity occur within species. Two prominent examples include evolutionary divergence between populations differentially adapted to their local environments (local adaptation), and divergence between females and males in response to sex differences in selection (sexual dimorphism sensu lato). These two forms of diversity have inspired vibrant research programmes, yet these fields have largely developed in isolation from one another. Nevertheless, conceptual parallels between these research traditions are striking. Opportunities for local adaptation strike a balance between local selection, which promotes divergence, and gene flow\u2014via dispersal and interbreeding between populations\u2014which constrains it. Sex differences are similarly constrained by fundamental features of inheritance that mimic gene flow. Offspring of each sex inherit genes from same-sex and opposite-sex parents, leading to gene flow between each differentially selected half of the population, and raising the question of how sex differences arise and are maintained. This special issue synthesizes and extends emerging research at the interface between the research traditions of local adaptation and sex differences. Each field can promote understanding of the other, and interactions between local adaptation and sex differences can generate new empirical predictions about the evolutionary consequences of selection that varies across space, time, and between the sexes.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue \u2018Linking local adaptation with the evolution of sex differences\u2019.",

      "abstractNote": "Spatially varying selection with gene flow can favour the evolution of inversions that bind locally adapted alleles together, facilitate local adaptation and ultimately drive genomic divergence between species. Several studies have shown that the rates of spread and establishment of new inversions capturing locally adaptive alleles depend on a suite of evolutionary factors, including the strength of selection for local adaptation, rates of gene flow and recombination, and the deleterious mutation load carried by inversions. Because the balance of these factors is expected to differ between X (or Z) chromosomes and autosomes, opportunities for inversion evolution are likely to systematically differ between these genomic regions, though such scenarios have not been formally modelled. Here, we consider the evolutionary dynamics of X-linked and autosomal inversions in populations evolving at a balance between migration and local selection. We identify three factors that lead to asymmetric rates of X-linked and autosome inversion establishment: (1) sex-biased migration, (2) dominance of locally adapted alleles and (3) chromosome-specific deleterious mutation loads. This theory predicts an elevated rate of fixation, and depressed opportunities for polymorphism, for X-linked inversions. Our survey of data on the genomic distribution of polymorphic and fixed inversions supports both theoretical predictions.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue \u2018Linking local adaptation with the evolution of sex differences'.",

      "abstractNote": "Chromosomal inversions contribute substantially to genome evolution, yet the processes governing their evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood. Theory suggests that a readily measurable property of inversions\u2014their length\u2014can potentially affect their evolutionary fates. Emerging data on the lengths of polymorphic and fixed inversions may therefore provide clues to the evolutionary processes promoting inversion establishment. However, formal predictions for the distribution of inversion lengths remain incomplete, making empirical patterns difficult to interpret. We model the relation between inversion length and establishment probability for four inversion types: (1) neutral, (2) underdominant, (3) directly beneficial, and (4) indirectly beneficial, with selection favouring the latter because they capture locally adapted alleles at migration-selection balance and suppress recombination between them. We also consider how deleterious mutations affect the lengths of established inversions. We show that length distributions of common polymorphic and fixed inversions systematically differ among inversion types. Small rearrangements contribute the most to genome evolution under neutral and underdominant scenarios of selection, with the lengths of neutral inversion substitutions increasing, and those of underdominant substitutions decreasing, with effective population size. Among directly beneficial inversions, small rearrangements are preferentially fixed, whereas intermediate-to-large inversions are maintained as balanced polymorphisms via associative overdominance. Finally, inversions established under the local adaptation scenario are predominantly intermediate-to-large. Such inversions remain polymorphic or approach fixation within the local populations where they are favoured. Our models clarify how inversion length distributions relate to processes of inversion establishment, providing a platform for testing how natural selection shapes the evolution of genome structure.",

The individuals can reproduce, die and migrate between the demes according to an arbitrary migration network. They are haploid, with two alleles present in the population; frequency-independent selection is also incorporated, where the strength and direction of selection can vary from deme to deme. The system is formulated as an individual-based model and the diffusion approximation systematically applied to express it as a set of nonlinear coupled stochastic differential equations. These can be made amenable to analysis through the elimination of fast-time variables. The resulting reduced model is analysed in a number of situations, including migration-selection balance leading to a polymorphic equilibrium of the two alleles and an illustration of how the subdivision of the population can lead to non-trivial behaviour in the case where the network is a simple hub. The method we develop is systematic, may be applied to any network, and agrees well with the results of simulations in all cases studied and across a wide range of parameter values.

      "abstractNote": "Adaptive divergence of phenotypes, such as sexual dimorphism or adaptive speciation, can result from disruptive selection via competition for limited resources. Theory indicates that speciation and sexual dimorphism can result from identical ecological conditions, but co-occurrence is unlikely because whichever evolves first should dissipate the disruptive selection necessary to drive evolution of the other. Here, we consider ecological conditions in which disruptive selection can act along multiple ecological axes. Speciation in lake populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has been attributed to disruptive selection due to competition for resources. Head shape in sticklebacks is thought to reflect adaptation to different resource acquisition strategies. We measure sexual dimorphism and species variation in head shape and body size in stickleback populations in two lakes in British Columbia, Canada. We find that sexual dimorphism in head shape is greater than interspecific differences. Using a numerical simulation model that contains two axes of ecological variation, we show that speciation and sexual dimorphism can readily co-occur when the effects of loci underlying sexually dimorphic traits are orthogonal to those underlying sexually selected traits.",

      "abstractNote": "Loci involved in local adaptation can potentially be identified by an unusual correlation between allele frequencies and important ecological variables or by extreme allele frequency differences between geographic regions. However, such comparisons are complicated by differences in sample sizes and the neutral correlation of allele frequencies across populations due to shared history and gene flow. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed a Bayesian method that estimates the empirical pattern of covariance in allele frequencies between populations from a set of markers and then uses this as a null model for a test at individual SNPs. In our model the sample frequencies of an allele across populations are drawn from a set of underlying population frequencies; a transform of these population frequencies is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. We first estimate the covariance matrix of this multivariate normal across loci using a Monte Carlo Markov chain. At each SNP, we then provide a measure of the support, a Bayes factor, for a model where an environmental variable has a linear effect on the transformed allele frequencies compared to a model given by the covariance matrix alone. This test is shown through power simulations to outperform existing correlation tests. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to identify SNPs with unusually large allele frequency differentiation and offers a powerful alternative to tests based on pairwise or global F(ST).

      "abstractNote": "Withstanding extinction while facing rapid climate change depends on a species\u2019 ability to track its ecological niche or to evolve a new one. Current methods that predict climate-driven species\u2019 range shifts use ecological modelling without eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here we present an eco-evolutionary forecasting framework that combines niche modelling with individual-based demographic and genetic simulations. Applying our approach to four endemic perennial plant species of the Austrian Alps, we show that accounting for eco-evolutionary dynamics when predicting species\u2019 responses to climate change is crucial. Perennial species persist in unsuitable habitats longer than predicted by niche modelling, causing delayed range losses; however, their evolutionary responses are constrained because long-lived adults produce increasingly maladapted offspring. Decreasing population size due to maladaptation occurs faster than the contraction of the species range, especially for the most abundant species. Monitoring of species\u2019 local abundance rather than their range may likely better inform on species\u2019 extinction risks under climate change.",

      "abstractNote": "The strength of mate choice (choosiness) often varies with age, but theory to understand this variation is scarce. Additionally, theory has investigated the evolution of choosiness in speciation scenarios but has ignored that most organisms have overlapping generations. We investigate whether speciation can result in variation of choosiness with age, and whether such variation can in turn affect speciation. We develop a population-genetic model of the evolution of choosiness in organisms with overlapping generations in the context of secondary contact between two divergent populations. We assume that females choose males that match their phenotype, such that choosiness evolves by sexual selection. We demonstrate that speciation can result in the evolution of age-specific choosiness when the mating trait is under divergent ecological selection and age is not used as a mating cue. The cause of this result is that allele frequencies differ between choosy females and males. However, we find that the evolution of age-specific choosiness does not affect the overall level of reproductive isolation compared to a case without age-structure, supporting previous speciation theory. Overall, our results connect life history and speciation theory, and the mechanisms that we highlight have implications for the understanding of the role of sex-specific selection in the evolution of choosiness.",

      "abstractNote": "The role of environmental heterogeneity in the evolution of biological diversity has been studied only for simple types of heterogeneities and dispersals. This article broadens previous results by considering heterogeneities and dispersals that are structured by several environmental factors. It studies the evolution of a metapopulation, living in a network of patches connected by dispersal, under the effects of mutation, selection and migration. First, it is assumed that patches are equally connected and that they carry habitats characterized by several factors exerting selection pressures on several individual traits. Habitat factors may vary in the environment independently or they may be correlated. It is shown that correlations between habitat factors promote adaptive diversification and that this effect may be modified by trait interactions on survival. Then, it is assumed that patches are structured by two crossed factors, called the row and column factors, such that patches are more connected when they occur in the same row or in the same column. Environmental patterns in which each habitat appears in each row the same number of times and appears in each column the same number of times are found to hinder adaptive diversification.",

      "abstractNote": "Tree taxa shifted latitude or elevation range in response to changes in Quaternary climate. Because many modern trees display adaptive differentiation in relation to latitude or elevation, it is likely that ancient trees were also so differentiated, with environmental sensitivities of populations throughout the range evolving in conjunction with migrations. Rapid climate changes challenge this process by imposing stronger selection and by distancing populations from environments to which they are adapted. The unprecedented rates of climate changes anticipated to occur in the future, coupled with land use changes that impede gene flow, can be expected to disrupt the interplay of adaptation and migration, likely affecting productivity and threatening the persistence of many species.",

      "abstractNote": "A model is presented to explore how the form of selection arising from competition for resources is affected by spatial resource heterogeneity. The model consists of a single species occupying two patches connected by migration, where the two patches can differ in the type of resources that they contain. The main goal is to determine the conditions under which competition for resources results in disruptive selection (i.e., selection favoring a polymorphism) since it is this form of selection that will give rise to the evolutionary diversification of resource exploitation strategies. In particular, comparing the conditions giving rise to disruptive selection when the two patches are identical to the conditions when they contain different resources reveals the effect of spatial resource heterogeneity. Results show that when the patches are identical, the conditions giving rise to disruptive selection are identical to those that give rise to character displacement in previous models. When the patches are different, the conditions giving rise to disruptive selection can be either more or less stringent depending upon demographic parameters such as the intrinsic rate of increase and the migration rate. Surprisingly, spatial resource heterogeneity can actually make forms of evolutionary diversification such as character displacement less likely. It is also found that results are dependent on how the resource exploitation strategies and the spatial resource heterogeneity affect the population dynamics. One robust conclusion however, is that spatial resource heterogeneity always has a disruptive effect when the migration rate between patches is low.",

The model assumes that competition for resources occurs within groups of a finite number of individuals (interaction groups), and that limited dispersal of individuals between groups (according to Wright's island model of population structure) results in genetic structuring of the population. It is found that both finite-sized interaction groups and limited dispersal can have substantial effects on the evolution of resource exploitation strategies as compared to models with a single, infinitely large, well-mixed interaction group. Both effects, in general, tend to select for less aggressive competitive strategies. Moreover, both effects also tend to reduce the likelihood of the evolutionary diversification of resource exploitation strategies that often occurs in models of resource competition with infinite populations. The results are discussed in the context of theories of the evolutionary diversification of resource exploitation strategies and speciation.",

      "abstractNote": "Most models for the evolution of host defense against parasites assume that host populations are not spatially structured. Yet local interactions and limited dispersal can strongly affect the evolutionary outcome, because they significantly alter epidemiological feedbacks and the spatial genetic structuring of the host and pathogen populations. We provide a general framework to study the evolution of a number of host life-history traits in a spatially structured host population infected by a horizontally transmitted parasite. Our analysis teases apart the selective pressures on hosts and helps disentangle the direct fitness effect of mutations and their indirect effects via the influence of spatial structure on the genetic, demographic, and epidemiological structure of the host population. We then illustrate the evolutionary consequences of spatial structure by focusing on the evolution of two host defense strategies against parasitism: suicide upon infection and reduced transmission. Because they bring no direct fitness benefit, these strategies are counterselected or selectively neutral in a nonspatial setting, but we show that they can be selected for in a spatially structured environment. Our study thus sheds light on the evolution of altruistic defense mechanisms that have been observed in various biological systems.",

      "abstractNote": "Quantitative-genetic models of differentiation under migration-selection balance often rely on the assumption of normally distributed genotypic and phenotypic values. When a population is subdivided into demes with selection toward different local optima, migration between demes may result in asymmetric, or skewed, local distributions. Using a simplified two-habitat model, we derive formulas without a priori assuming a Gaussian distribution of genotypic values, and we find expressions that naturally incorporate higher moments, such as skew. These formulas yield predictions of the expected divergence under migration-selection balance that are more accurate than models assuming Gaussian distributions, which illustrates the importance of incorporating these higher moments to assess the response to selection in heterogeneous environments. We further show with simulations that traits with loci of large effect display the largest skew in their distribution at migration-selection balance.",

      "abstractNote": "Quantitative-genetic models of differentiation under migration-selection balance often rely on the assumption of normally distributed genotypic and phenotypic values. When a population is subdivided into demes with selection toward different local optima, migration between demes may result in asymmetric, or skewed, local distributions. Using a simpli\ufb01ed two-habitat model, we derive formulas without a priori assuming a Gaussian distribution of genotypic values, and we \ufb01nd expressions that naturally incorporate higher moments, such as skew. These formulas yield predictions of the expected divergence under migration-selection balance that are more accurate than models assuming Gaussian distributions, which illustrates the importance of incorporating these higher moments to assess the response to selection in heterogeneous environments. We further show with simulations that traits with loci of large effect display the largest skew in their distribution at migration-selection balance.",

      "abstractNote": "We study the evolution of specialization in a spatially continuous (one-dimensional) environment divided into two habitats; we use a general trade-off function relating fitnesses in the two habitats and illustrate our results with two classical trade-off functions. We show that the population can either reach an intermediate value of the trait and be moderately adapted to both habitats (1 generalist), or split into two locally adapted subpopulations (2 specialists). We recover the qualitative results obtained with simpler metapopulation models with island migration: the evolutionary outcome depends on the concavity of the trade-off, on the proportion of each habitat and on migration. Our quantitative prediction on migration, however, depends on isolation by distance. Our spatially explicit model may thus be particularly useful to describe the evolutionary dynamics of specialization in, perhaps, more realistic ecological scenarios.",

      "abstractNote": "How do mutation and gene flow influence population persistence, niche expansion and local adaptation in spatially heterogeneous environments? In this article, we analyse a demographic and evolutionary model of adaptation to an environment containing two habitats in equal frequencies, and we bridge the gap between different theoretical frameworks. Qualitatively, our model yields four qualitative types of outcomes: (i) global extinction of the population, (ii) adaptation to one habitat only, but also adaptation to both habitats with, (iii) specialized phenotypes or (iv) with generalized phenotypes, and we determine the conditions under which each equilibrium is reached. We derive new analytical approximations for the local densities and the distributions of traits in each habitat under a migration\u2013selection\u2013mutation balance, compute the equilibrium values of the means, variances and asymmetries of the local distributions of phenotypes, and contrast the effects of migration and mutation on the evolutionary outcome. We then check our analytical results by solving our model numerically, and also assess their robustness in the presence of demographic stochasticity. Although increased migration results in a decrease in local adaptation, mutation in our model does not influence the values of the local mean traits. Yet, both migration and mutation can have dramatic effects on population size and even lead to metapopulation extinction when selection is strong. Niche expansion, the ability for the population to adapt to both habitats, can also be prevented by small migration rates and a reduced evolutionary potential characterized by rare mutation events of small effects; however, niche expansion is otherwise the most likely outcome. Although our results are derived under the assumption of clonal reproduction, we finally show and discuss the links between our model and previous quantitative genetics models.",

      "title": "The best of both worlds: Combining population genetic and quantitative genetic models",
      "abstractNote": "Numerous traits under migration\u2013selection balance are shown to exhibit complex patterns of genetic architecture with large variance in effect sizes. However, the conditions under which such genetic architectures are stable have yet to be investigated, because studying the influence of a large number of small allelic effects on the maintenance of spatial polymorphism is mathematically challenging, due to the high complexity of the systems that arise. In particular, in the most simple case of a haploid population in a two-patch environment, while it is known from population genetics that polymorphism at a single major-effect locus is stable in the symmetric case, there exist no analytical predictions on how this polymorphism holds when a polygenic background also contributes to the trait. Here we propose to answer this question by introducing a new eco-evo methodology that allows us to take into account the combined contributions of a major-effect locus and of a quantitative background resulting from small-effect loci, where inheritance is encoded according to an extension to the infinitesimal model. In a regime of small variance contributed by the quantitative loci, we justify that traits are concentrated around the major alleles, according to a normal distribution, using new convex analysis arguments. This allows a reduction in the complexity of the system using a separation of time scales approach. We predict an undocumented phenomenon of loss of polymorphism at the major-effect locus despite strong selection for local adaptation, because the quantitative background slowly disrupts the rapidly established polymorphism at the major-effect locus, which is confirmed by individual-based simulations. Our study highlights how segregation of a quantitative background can greatly impact the dynamics of major-effect loci by provoking migrational meltdowns. We also provide a comprehensive toolbox designed to describe how to apply our method to more complex population genetic models.",

      "abstractNote": "A proper understanding of the links between varying gene expression levels and complex trait adaptation is still lacking, despite recent advances in sequencing techniques leading to new insights on their importance in some evolutionary processes. This calls for extensions of the continuum-of-alleles framework first introduced by Kimura (1965 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 54 731\u201336) that bypass the classical Gaussian approximation. Here, we propose a novel mathematical framework to study the evolutionary dynamics of quantitative alleles for sexually reproducing populations under natural selection and competition through an integro-differential equation. It involves a new reproduction operator which is nonlinear and nonlocal. This reproduction operator is different from the infinitesimal operator used in other studies with sexual reproduction because of different underlying genetic structures. In an asymptotic regime where initially the population has a small phenotypic variance, we analyse the long-term dynamics of the phenotypic distributions according to the methodology of small variance (Diekmann et al 2005 Theor. Popul. Biol. 67 257\u201371). In particular, we prove that the reproduction operator strains the limit distribution to be a product measure. Under some assumptions on the limit equation, we show that the population remains monomorphic, that is the phenotypic distribution remains concentrated as a moving Dirac mass. Moreover, in the case of a monomorphic distribution, we derive a canonical equation describing the dynamics of the dominant alleles.",

      "title": "Evolutionary dynamics of complex traits in sexual populations in a heterogeneous environment: how normal?",
      "abstractNote": "When studying the dynamics of trait distribution of populations in a heterogeneous environment, classical models from quantitative genetics choose to look at its system of moments, specifically the first two ones. Additionally, in order to close the resulting system of equations, they often assume the local trait distributions are Gaussian [see for instance Ronce and Kirkpatrick (Evolution 55(8):1520-1531, 2001. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00672.x.37 )]. The aim of this paper is to introduce a mathematical framework that follows the whole trait distribution (without prior assumption) to study evolutionary dynamics of sexually reproducing populations. Specifically, it focuses on complex traits, whose inheritance can be encoded by the infinitesimal model of segregation (Fisher in Trans R Soc Edinb 52(2):399-433, 1919. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0080456800012163 ). We show that it allows us to derive a regime in which our model gives the same dynamics as when assuming Gaussian local trait distributions. To support that, we compare the stationary problems of the system of moments derived from our model with the one given in Ronce and Kirkpatrick (Evolution 55(8):1520-1531, 2001. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00672.x.37 ) and show that they are equivalent under this regime and do not need to be otherwise. Moreover, under this regime of equivalence, we show that a separation bewteen ecological and evolutionary time scales arises. A fast relaxation toward monomorphism allows us to reduce the complexity of the system of moments, using a slow-fast analysis. This reduction leads us to complete, still in this regime, the analytical description of the bistable asymmetrical equilibria numerically found in Ronce and Kirkpatrick (Evolution 55(8):1520-1531, 2001. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00672.x.37 ). More globally, we provide explicit modelling hypotheses that allow for such local adaptation patterns to occur.",

      "abstractNote": "When individuals have higher fitness in their local environment than individuals from elsewhere, this is termed local adaptation (Williams 1966). This occurs when natural selection acts on traits differently depending on environmental conditions, which can vary in both space and time. Classically, tests for local adaptation involve reciprocal-transplant experiments that involve moving individuals among sites and measuring their performance relative to a home/local versus away/foreign scenario, such that a measure of fitness can be obtained. This approach has a long tradition. Following in the footsteps of Turesson (1922), who performed common-garden studies, Clausen et al. (1948) performed a reciprocal-transplant study based on a desire to understand the extent to which plasticity versus genetic differentiation (i.e., adaptation) contributed to the fluidity of forms seen within a single species across environments (Nunez-Farfan and Schlichting 2001). However, this tried-and-true empirical approach, while a gold standard for revealing local adaptation, places a limit on aspects of its study. Many organisms are difficult, if not impossible, to transplant without harm, and others are sufficiently long lived that adequate measures of fitness are hard for researchers to obtain. Notably, Turesson, Clausen, Keck, and Hiesey worked with herbaceous, flowering plants, which are easily grown, relatively short-lived, and also often exhibit easily observed and measureable quantitative phenotypic variation.",

      "abstractNote": "The adaptation to a variable environment has been studied within soft and hard selection frameworks. It is shown that an epistatically determined habitat preference, following a Markovian process, always leads to the maintenance of an adaptive polymorphism, in a soft selection context. Although local mating does not alter the conditions for polymorphism maintenance, it is shown that, in that case, habitat selection also leads to the evolution of isolated reproductive units within each available habitat. Habitat selection, however, cannot evolve in the total absence of adaptive polymorphism. This represents a theoretical problem for all models assuming habitat selection to be an initially fixed trait, and means that within a soft selection framework, all the available habitats will be exploited, even the less favourable ones.",

      "abstractNote": "The study of local adaptation is rendered difficult by many evolutionary confounding phenomena (for example, genetic drift and demographic history). When complex traits are involved in local adaptation, phenomena such as phenotypic plasticity further hamper evolutionary biologists to study the complex relationships between phenotype, genotype and environment. In this perspective paper, we suggest that the common garden experiment, specifically designed to deal with phenotypic plasticity, has a clear role to play in the study of local adaptation, even (if not specifically) in the genomic era. After a quick review of some high-throughput genotyping protocols relevant in the context of a common garden, we explore how to improve common garden analyses with dense marker panel data and recent statistical methods. We then show how combining approaches from population genomics and genome-wide association studies with the settings of a common garden can yield to a very efficient, thorough and integrative study of local adaptation. Especially, evidence from genomic (for example, genome scan) and phenotypic origins constitute independent insights into the possibility of local adaptation scenarios, and genome-wide association studies in the context of a common garden experiment allow to decipher the genetic bases of adaptive traits.",

      "abstractNote": "Genome-scan methods are used for screening genomewide patterns of DNA polymorphism to detect signatures of positive selection. There are two main types of methods: (i) \u2018outlier\u2019 detection methods based on that detect loci with high differentiation compared to the rest of the genome and (ii) environmental association methods that test the association between allele frequencies and environmental variables. We present a new -based genome-scan method, BayeScEnv, which incorporates environmental information in the form of \u2018environmental differentiation\u2019. It is based on the F model, but, as opposed to existing approaches, it considers two locus-specific effects: one due to divergent selection and the other due to various other processes different from local adaptation (e.g. range expansions, differences in mutation rates across loci or background selection). The method was developped in C++ and is available at http://github.com/devillemereuil/bayescenv. A simulation study shows that our method has a much lower false positive rate than an existing -based method, BayeScan, under a wide range of demographic scenarios. Although it has lower power, it leads to a better compromise between power and false positive rate. We apply our method to a human data set and show that it can be used successfully to study local adaptation. We discuss its scope and compare it to other existing methods.",

      "abstractNote": "A deterministic computer simulation was made of a population occupying two niches. The size of the population in each niche was assumed constant, and there was gene flow between niches. The gene flow represented pollen transfer among plant populations. The basic model described one gene with two alleles, different alleles being selectively favored in different niches. This model was extended to investigate, in turn, situations where the character undergoing selection was polygenic, where there were modifiers causing linkage of the polygenes, where there were modifiers causing changes in the dominance relations of the alleles, and where genes determined assortative mating and self-fertility. Results showed that a polymorphism could be maintained particularly with high levels of selection and/or low levels of gene flow, both in single-gene and polygenic cases. Linkage modifiers spread slowly in the population, but evolution of dominance or overdominance occurred rapidly, particularly under high levels of selection and gene flow. Isolation between populations in each of the two niches could arise through assortative mating or through self-fertility. The conditions under which each of these evolutionary steps occurred were clearly defined. Selection in heterogeneous environments with migration between subhabitats was shown to occur in several qualitatively different ways (\"migration-selection cycles\"). The assumptions of the model and the results were discussed in relation to studies on natural and experimental populations.",

      "abstractNote": "We study the evolution of dispersal rates In a two parch metapopulation model. The local dynamics in each patch are given by difference equations, which, together with the rate of dispersal between the patches, determine the ecological dynamics of the metapopulation. We assume that phenotypes are given by their dispersal rate. The evolutionary dynamics in phenotype space are determined by invasion exponents, which describe whether a mutant can invade a given resident population. If the resident metapopulation is at a stable equilibrium, then selection on dispersal rates is neutral if the population sizes in the two patches are the same, while selection drives dispersal rates to zero if the local abundances are different. With non-equilibrium metapopulation dynamics, non-zero dispersal rates can be maintained by selection. In this case, and if the patches are: ecologically identical, dispersal rates always evolve to values which induce synchronized metapopulation dynamics. If the patches are ecologically different, evolutionary branching into two coexisting dispersal phenotypes can be observed. Such branching can happen repeatedly, leading to polymorphisms with more than two phenotypes. If there is a cost to dispersal, evolutionary cycling in phenotype space can occur due to the dependence of selection pressures on the ecological attractor of the resident population, or because phenotypic branching alternates with the extinction of one of the branches. Our results extend those of Holt and McPeek (1996), and suggest that phenotypic branching is an important evolutionary process. This process may be relevant for sympatric speciation.",

      "abstractNote": "Traditional discussions of speciation are based on geographical patterns of species ranges1,2. In allopatric speciation, long-term geographical isolation generates reproductively isolated and spatially segregated descendant species1,3. In the absence of geographical barriers, diversification is hindered by gene flow1,3,4. Yet a growing body of phylogenetic and experimental data suggests that closely related species often occur in sympatry or have adjacent ranges in regions over which environmental changes are gradual and do not prevent gene flow5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Theory has identified a variety of evolutionary processes that can result in speciation under sympatric conditions15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25, with some recent advances concentrating on the phenomenon of evolutionary branching18,23,24,25. Here we establish a link between geographical patterns and ecological processes of speciation by studying evolutionary branching in spatially structured populations. We show that along an environmental gradient, evolutionary branching can occur much more easily than in non-spatial models. This facilitation is most pronounced for gradients of intermediate slope. Moreover, spatial evolutionary branching readily generates patterns of spatial segregation and abutment between the emerging species. Our results highlight the importance of local processes of adaptive divergence for geographical patterns of speciation, and caution against pitfalls of inferring past speciation processes from present biogeographical patterns.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract: Several empirical studies put forward sexual selection as an important driving force of sympatric speciation. This idea agrees with recent models suggesting that speciation may proceed by means of divergent Fisherian runaway processes within a single population. Notwithstanding this, the models so far have not been able to demonstrate that sympatric speciation can unfold as a fully adaptive process driven by sexual selection alone. Implicitly or explicitly, most models rely on nonselective factors to initiate speciation. In fact, they do not provide a selective explanation for the considerable variation in female preferences required to trigger divergent runaway processes. We argue that such variation can arise by disruptive selection but only when selection on female preferences is frequency dependent. Adaptive speciation is therefore unattainable in traditional female choice models, which assume selection on female preferences to be frequency independent. However, when frequency\u2010dependent sexual selection processes act alongside mate choice, truly adaptive sympatric speciation becomes feasible. Speciation is then initiated independently of nonadaptive processes and does not suffer from the theoretical weaknesses associated with the current Fisherian runaway model of speciation. However, adaptive speciation requires the simultaneous action of multiple mechanisms, and therefore it occurs under conditions far more restrictive than earlier models of sympatric speciation by sexual selection appear to suggest.",

      "abstractNote": "There is a considerable impetus in population genomics to pinpoint loci involved in local adaptation. A powerful approach to find genomic regions subject to local adaptation is to genotype numerous molecular markers and look for outlier loci. One of the most common approaches for selection scans is based on statistics that measure population differentiation such as FST. However, there are important caveats with approaches related to FST because they require grouping individuals into populations and they additionally assume a particular model of population structure. Here, we implement a more flexible individual-based approach based on Bayesian factor models. Factor models capture population structure with latent variables called factors, which can describe clustering of individuals into populations or isolation-by-distance patterns. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we both infer population structure and identify outlier loci that are candidates for local adaptation. In order to identify outlier loci, the hierarchical factor model searches for loci that are atypically related to population structure as measured by the latent factors. In a model of population divergence, we show that it can achieve a 2-fold or more reduction of false discovery rate compared with the software BayeScan or with an FST approach. We show that our software can handle large data sets by analyzing the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the Human Genome Diversity Project. The Bayesian factor model is implemented in the open-source PCAdapt software.",

      "abstractNote": "Dispersal, the tendency for organisms to reproduce away from their parents, influences many evolutionary and ecological processes, from speciation and extinction events, to the coexistence of genotypes within species or biological invasions. Understanding how dispersal evolves is crucial to predict how global changes might affect species persistence and geographical distribution. The factors driving the evolution of dispersal have been well characterized from a theoretical standpoint, and predictions have been made about their respective influence on, for example, dispersal polymorphism or the emergence of dispersal syndromes. However, the experimental tests of some theories remain scarce partly because a synthetic view of theoretical advances is still lacking. Here, we review the different ingredients of models of dispersal evolution, from selective pressures and types of predictions, through mathematical and ecological assumptions, to the methods used to obtain predictions. We provide perspectives as to which predictions are easiest to test, how theories could be better exploited to provide testable predictions, what theoretical developments are needed to tackle this topic, and we place the question of the evolution of dispersal within the larger interdisciplinary framework of eco-evolutionary dynamics.",

      "abstractNote": "Parasites are generally expected to be locally adapted to their hosts, but the basis of this prediction involves two distinct areas of research: coevolutionary studies of infectivity and epidemiological studies of optimal virulence. The distinction between infectivity and virulence is sometimes blurred but is crucial to our understanding of parasite local adaptation. Recent theoretical and empirical work has greatly improved our understanding of the evolutionary processes affecting local infectivity adaptation. However, in spite of the attention paid to the evolution of virulence, only a few recent models have explicitly studied spatial variation in optimal virulence. Our understanding of parasite local adaptation will continue to improve through studies of the genetic basis of infectivity, research on spatial variation in optimal virulence in multiple-deme systems, and the combination of these two interacting components of parasite infection in theoretical and empirical studies.",

In a horizontally transmitted microparasitic disease in Daphnia, a planktonic crustacean, increasing geographic distance between host and parasite origin was found to be correlated with a decrease in spore production and virulence. This finding indicates local adaptation of the parasite, but contradicts the hypothesis that long-standing coevolved parasites are less virulent than novel parasites. Virulence can be explained as the consequence of balancing the positive genetic correlation between host mortality and strain-specific spore production.",

      "abstractNote": "The comparison between quantitative genetic divergence (QST) and neutral genetic divergence (FST) among populations has become the standard test for historical signatures of selection on quantitative traits. However, when the mutation rate of neutral markers is relatively high in comparison with gene flow, estimates of FST will decrease, resulting in upwardly biased comparisons of QST vs. FST. Reviewing empirical studies, the difference between QST and FST is positively related to marker heterozygosity. After refuting alternative explanations for this pattern, we conclude that marker mutation rate indeed has had a biasing effect on published QST\u2013FST comparisons. Hence, it is no longer clear that populations have commonly diverged in response to divergent selection. We present and discuss potential solutions to this bias. Comparing QST with recent indices of neutral divergence that statistically correct for marker heterozygosity (Hedrick\u2019s G\u2032st and Jost\u2019s D) is not advised, because these indices are not theoretically equivalent to QST. One valid solution is to estimate FST from neutral markers with mutation rates comparable to those of the loci underlying quantitative traits (e.g. SNPs). QST can also be compared to \u03a6ST (PhiST) of amova, as long as the genetic distance among allelic variants used to estimate \u03a6ST reflects evolutionary history: in that case, neutral divergence is independent of mutation rate. In contrast to their common usage in comparisons of QST and FST, microsatellites typically have high mutation rates and do not evolve according to a simple evolutionary model, so are best avoided in QST\u2013FST comparisons.",

      "abstractNote": "Dispersal is an important life-history trait involved in species persistence, evolution, and diversification, yet is one of the least understood concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology. There is a growing realization that dispersal might not involve the random sample of genotypes as is typically assumed, but instead can be enriched for certain genotypes. Here, we review and compare various sources of such non-random gene flow, and summarize its effects on local adaptation and resource use, metapopulation dynamics, adaptation to climate change, biological invasion, and speciation. Given the possible ubiquity and impacts of non-random gene flow, there is an urgent need for the fields of evolution and ecology to test for non-random gene flow and to more fully incorporate its effects into theory.",

      "abstractNote": "An invasive plant species may restrict its spread to only one type of habitat, or, after some time, may continue to spread into a different, often stressful, secondary, habitat. The question of whether evolution is required for an invasive species to spread from one habitat to another is currently hotly debated. In order for local adaptation to occur, genetic variation must be present within invasive populations. In this paper, I focus on the effect of habitat on the maintenance of genetic variation during the lag phase, the phase of population stability prior to expansion. Genetic diversity in invasive plant populations accumulates through multiple introductions, gene flow, mutation, and hybridization, but diversity is maintained by population level processes influencing effective population size (Ne). I show that when the plastic response to the environment results in little variation in reproductive output among individuals, Ne is maximized and genetic variation is maintained. Established models of plant competition show that below-ground competition reduces the variation in reproductive output, whereas competition for light increases variation in reproductive output. The same environments that maintain high Ne also reduce the opportunity for selection and minimize the response to selection, and thus the effects of the environment are synchronized to prevent genetic purges. When the primary invasion habitat supports high Ne, conditions are ripe for local adaptation to a secondary habitat, particularly if the secondary habitat has high opportunity for selection. When the primary invasion habitat supports low Ne, genetic diversity is less likely to be sufficient for local adaptation to secondary habitat to occur.",

      "title": "Detecting loci under selection in a hierarchically structured population",
      "abstractNote": "Patterns of genetic diversity between populations are often used to detect loci under selection in genome scans. Indeed, loci involved in local adaptations should show high FST values, whereas loci under balancing selection should rather show low FST values. Most tests of selection based on FST use a null distribution generated under a simple island model of population differentiation. Although this model has been shown to be robust, many species have a more complex genetic structure, with some populations sharing a recent ancestry or due to the presence of barriers to gene flow between different parts of a species range. In this paper, we propose the use of a hierarchical island model, in which demes exchange more migrants within groups than between groups, to generate the joint distribution of genetic diversity within and between populations. We show that tests not accounting for a hierarchical structure, when it exists, do generate a large excess of false positive loci, whereas the hierarchical island model is robust to uncertainties about the exact number of groups and demes per group in the system. Our approach also explicitly takes into account the mutational process, and does not just rely on allele frequencies, which is important for short tandem repeat (STR) data. An application to human and stickleback STR data sets reveals a much lower number of significant loci than previously obtained under a non-hierarchical model. The elimination of false positive loci from genome scans should allow us to better determine on which specific class of genes selection is operating.",

      "abstractNote": "As Earth is currently experiencing dramatic climate change, it is of critical interest to understand how species will respond to it. The chance of a species withstanding climate change is likely to\u00a0depend on the diversity within the species and, particularly, whether there are sub-populations that are already adapted to extreme environments. However, most predictive studies ignore that species comprise genetically diverse individuals. We have identified genetic variants in Arabidopsis thaliana that are associated with survival of an extreme drought event-a major consequence of global warming. Subsequently, we determined how these variants are distributed across the native range of the species. Genetic alleles conferring higher drought survival showed signatures of polygenic adaptation and were more frequently found in Mediterranean and Scandinavian regions. Using geo-environmental models, we predicted that Central European, but not Mediterranean, populations might lag behind in adaptation by the end of the twenty-first century. Further analyses showed that a population decline could nevertheless be compensated by natural selection acting efficiently over standing variation or by migration of adapted individuals from populations at the margins of the species' distribution. These findings highlight the importance of within-species genetic heterogeneity in facilitating an evolutionary response to a changing climate.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding evolutionary genomic and population processes within a species range is key to anticipating the extinction of plant species before it is too late. However, most models of biodiversity risk under global change do not account for the genetic variation and local adaptation of different populations. Population diversity is critical to understanding extinction because different populations may be more or less susceptible to global change and, if lost, would reduce the total diversity within a species. Two new modeling frameworks advance our understanding of extinction from a population and evolutionary angle: Rapid climate change-driven disruptions in population adaptation are predicted from associations between genomes and local climates. Furthermore, losses of population diversity from global land-use transformations are estimated by scaling relationships of species' genomic diversity with habitat area. Overall, these global eco-evolutionary methods advance the predictability \u2013 and possibly the preventability \u2013 of the ongoing extinction of plant species.",

      "title": "The Efficacy of Divergence Hitchhiking in Generating Genomic Islands During Ecological Speciation",
      "abstractNote": "Genes under divergent selection flow less readily between populations than other loci. This observation has led to verbal \"divergence hitchhiking\" models of speciation in which decreased interpopulation gene flow surrounding loci under divergent selection can generate large regions of differentiation within the genome (genomic islands). The efficacy of this model in promoting speciation depends on the size of the region affected by divergence hitchhiking. Empirical evidence is mixed, with examples of both large and small genomic islands. To address these empirical discrepancies and to formalize the theory, we present mathematical models of divergence hitchhiking, which examine neutral differentiation around selected sites. For a single locus under selection, regions of differentiation do not extend far along a chromosome away from a selected site unless both effective population sizes and migration rates are low. When multiple loci are considered, regions of differentiation can be larger. However, with many loci under selection, genome-wide divergence occurs and genomic islands are erased. The results show that divergence hitchhiking can generate large regions of differentiation, but that the conditions under which this occurs are limited. Thus, speciation may often require multifarious selection acting on many, isolated and physically unlinked genes. How hitchhiking promotes further adaptive divergence warrants consideration.",

In this new view it is important to understand the conditions under which 'divergence hitchhiking' associated with the physical linkage of gene regions, versus 'genome hitchhiking' associated with reductions in genome-wide rates of gene flow caused by selection, can enhance speciation-with-gene-flow. We describe here a theory predicting four phases of speciation, defined by changes in the relative effectiveness of divergence and genome hitchhiking, and review empirical data in light of the theory. We outline future directions, emphasizing the need to couple next-generation sequencing with selection, transplant, functional genomics, and mapping studies. This will permit a natural history of speciation genomics that will help to elucidate the factors responsible for population divergence and the roles that genome structure and different forms of hitchhiking play in facilitating the genesis of new biodiversity.",

      "abstractNote": "Prior studies of the evolution of species\u2019 niches and ranges have identified the importance of within\u2010population genetic variance, migration rate, and environmental heterogeneity in determining evolutionarily stable patterns of species\u2019 range and habitat use. Different combinations of these variables can produce either habitat specialists or generalists and cause either stable range limits or unbounded expansion. We examine the effect of density regulation on a species\u2019 range and habitat use within a landscape comprised of two discrete habitats and along continuous environmental gradients. Using the theta\u2010logistic formulation, we demonstrate the following. (1) Spatially uniform density regulation generally weakens gene swamping and opposes habitat specialization and range limitation. (2) The form of density regulation should play an important role in determining whether the equilibrium species' range is limited by gene flow. (3) Even when no long\u2010term limited\u2010range equilibrium occurs, quasi\u2010stable (or even contracting) range limits may be maintained for a long period during the initial phases of an invasion; the length of this period depends on the form of density regulation. (4) The steady state invasion speed in heterogeneous environments depends on the form of density regulation. Implications for the study of biological invasions are discussed, and directions for further exploration are sketched.",

      "abstractNote": "Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers. The method has been implemented in a new software available at our website (http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm).",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding the mechanisms of species coexistence has always been a fundamental topic in ecology. Classical theory predicts that interspecific competition may select for traits that stabilize niche differences, although recent work shows that this is not strictly necessary. Here, we ask whether adaptive phenotypic plasticity could allow species coexistence (i.e., some stability at an equilibrium point) without ecological differentiation in habitat use. We used individual-based stochastic simulations defining a landscape composed of spatially uncorrelated or autocorrelated environmental patches, where two species with the same competitive strategies, not able to coexist without some form of phenotypic plasticity, expanded their ranges in the absence of a competition\u2014colonization trade-off (a well-studied mechanism for species diversity). Each patch is characterized by a random environmental value that determines the optimal phenotype of its occupants. In such a scenario, only local adaptation and gene flow (migration) may interact to promote genetic variation and coexistence in the metapopulation. Results show that a competitively inferior species with adaptive phenotypic plasticity can coexist in a same patch with a competitively superior, non-plastic species, provided the migration rates and variances of the patches' environmental values are sufficiently large.",

      "abstractNote": "Identifying adaptive loci can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. Genotype\u2013environment association (GEA) methods, which identify these loci based on correlations between genetic and environmental data, are particularly promising. Univariate methods have dominated GEA, despite the high dimensional nature of genotype and environment. Multivariate methods, which analyse many loci simultaneously, may be better suited to these data as they consider how sets of markers covary in response to environment. These methods may also be more effective at detecting adaptive processes that result in weak, multilocus signatures. Here, we evaluate four multivariate methods and five univariate and differentiation-based approaches, using published simulations of multilocus selection. We found that Random Forest performed poorly for GEA. Univariate GEAs performed better, but had low detection rates for loci under weak selection. Constrained ordinations, particularly redundancy analysis (RDA), showed a superior combination of low false-positive and high true-positive rates across all levels of selection. These results were robust across the demographic histories, sampling designs, sample sizes and weak population structure tested here. The value of combining detections from different methods was variable and depended on the study goals and knowledge of the drivers of selection. Re-analysis of genomic data from grey wolves highlighted the unique, covarying sets of adaptive loci that could be identified using RDA. Although additional testing is needed, this study indicates that RDA is an effective means of detecting adaptation, including signatures of weak, multilocus selection, providing a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation.",

      "abstractNote": "Although temporally changing environments generally favor sex and recombination, the effects of spatial environmental heterogeneity have been less explored. In this article, we use a classical model of adaptation along with an environmental gradient to study the selective forces acting on reproductive mode evolution in the central and marginal parts of the distribution range of a species. The model considers a polygenic trait under stabilizing selection (the optimal trait value changing across space) and includes a demographic component imposing range limits. The results show that in the central part of the range (where populations are well adapted), recombination tends to increase the mean fitness of offspring in regimes where drift is sufficiently strong (generating a benefit for sex), while it has the opposite effect when the effect of drift stays negligible. However, these effects remain weak and are easily overwhelmed by slight intrinsic fitness differences between sexuals and asexuals. In agreement with previous results, asexuality may be favored in marginal populations, as it can preserve adaptation to extreme conditions. However, a substantial advantage of asexuality is possible only in conditions maintaining a strong maladaptation of sexuals at range limits (high effective environmental gradient, weak selection at loci coding for the trait).",

The process of adaptation to novel environmental conditions can occur via two mechanisms: (1) the expression of phenotypic plasticity (the ability of one genotype to express varying phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions), and (2) evolution via selection for particular phenotypes, resulting in the modification of genetic variation in the population. Plasticity, because it acts at the level of the individual, is often hailed as a rapid-response mechanism that will enable organisms to adapt and survive in our rapidly changing world. But plasticity can also retard adaptation by shifting the distribution of phenotypes in the population, shielding it from natural selection. In addition to which, not all plastic responses are adaptive\u2014now well-documented in cases of ecological traps. In this theme issue, we aim to present a considered view of plasticity and the role it could play in facilitating or hindering adaption to environmental change. This introduction provides a re-examination of our current understanding of the role of phenotypic plasticity in adaptation and sets the theme issue's contributions in their broader context. Four key themes emerge: the need to measure plasticity across both space and time; the importance of the past in predicting the future; the importance of the link between plasticity and sexual selection; and the need to understand more about the nature of selection on plasticity itself. We conclude by advocating the need for cross-disciplinary collaborations to settle the question of whether plasticity will promote or retard species' rates of adaptation to ever-more stressful environmental conditions.This article is part of the theme issue \u2018The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change\u2019.",

      "title": "Extent and scale of local adaptation in salmonid fishes: review and meta-analysis",
      "abstractNote": "What is the extent and scale of local adaptation (LA)? How quickly does LA arise? And what is its underlying molecular basis? Our review and meta-analysis on salmonid fishes estimates the frequency of LA to be \u223c55\u201370%, with local populations having a 1.2 times average fitness advantage relative to foreign populations or to their performance in new environments. Salmonid LA is evident at a variety of spatial scales (for example, few km to>1000\u2009km) and can manifest itself quickly (6\u201330 generations). As the geographic scale between populations increases, LA is generally more frequent and stronger. Yet the extent of LA in salmonids does not appear to differ from that in other assessed taxa. Moreover, the frequency with which foreign salmonid populations outperform local populations (\u223c23\u201335%) suggests that drift, gene flow and plasticity often limit or mediate LA. The relatively few studies based on candidate gene and genomewide analyses have identified footprints of selection at both small and large geographical scales, likely reflecting the specific functional properties of loci and the associated selection regimes (for example, local niche partitioning, pathogens, parasites, photoperiodicity and seasonal timing). The molecular basis of LA in salmonids is still largely unknown, but differential expression at the same few genes is implicated in the convergent evolution of certain phenotypes. Collectively, future research will benefit from an integration of classical and molecular approaches to understand: (i) species differences and how they originate, (ii) variation in adaptation across scales, life stages, population sizes and environmental gradients, and (iii) evolutionary responses to human activities.",

      "abstractNote": "Adaptation to local environments often occurs through natural selection acting on a large number of loci, each having a weak phenotypic effect. One way to detect these loci is to identify genetic polymorphisms that exhibit high correlation with environmental variables used as proxies for ecological pressures. Here, we propose new algorithms based on population genetics, ecological modeling, and statistical learning techniques to screen genomes for signatures of local adaptation. Implemented in the computer program \"latent factor mixed model\" (LFMM), these algorithms employ an approach in which population structure is introduced using unobserved variables. These fast and computationally efficient algorithms detect correlations between environmental and genetic variation while simultaneously inferring background levels of population structure. Comparing these new algorithms with related methods provides evidence that LFMM can efficiently estimate random effects due to population history and isolation-by-distance patterns when computing gene-environment correlations, and decrease the number of false-positive associations in genome scans. We then apply these models to plant and human genetic data, identifying several genes with functions related to development that exhibit strong correlations with climatic gradients.",

      "abstractNote": "In populations of phytophagous insects that use the host plant as a rendezvous for mating, divergence in host preference could lead to sympatric speciation. Speciation requires the elimination of \"generalist\" genotypes, that is, those with intermediate host preference. This could occur because such genotypes have an inherent fitness disadvantage, or because preference alleles become associated with alleles that are oppositely selected on the two hosts. Although the former mechanism has been shown to be plausible, the latter mechanism has not been studied in detail. I consider a multilocus model (the \"Bush model\") in which one set of biallelic loci affects host preference, and a second set affects viability on the hosts once chosen. Alleles that increase viability on one host decrease viability on the other, and all loci are assumed to be unlinked. With moderately strong selection on the viability loci, preference alleles rapidly become associated with viability alleles, and the population splits into two reproductively isolated host specialist populations. The conditions for speciation to occur in this model, as measured by the strength of selection required, are somewhat more stringent than in a model in which preference and viability are controlled by the same loci (one-trait model). In contrast, the conditions are much less stringent than in a model in which speciation requires buildup of associations between viability loci and loci controlling a host-independent assortative mating trait (canonical two-trait model). Moreover, in the one-trait model, and to a lesser extent the Bush model, the strength of selection needed to initiate speciation is only slightly greater than that needed to complete it. This indicates that documenting instances of sympatric species that are reproductively isolated only by host or habitat preference would provide evidence for the plausibility of sympatric speciation in nature.",

However, a thorough description of the underlying genetics of the coevolutionary process is often extremely difficult to carry out.

We discuss recent experimental work in the light of simple mathematical models of coevolution to demonstrate the potential power of this phenotypic experimental approach.",

      "title": "Interactions between genetic drift, gene flow, and selection mosaics drive parasite local adaptation",
      "abstractNote": "Interactions between gene flow, spatially variable selection, and genetic drift have long been a central focus of evolutionary research. In contrast, only recently has the potential importance of interactions between these factors for coevolutionary dynamics and the emergence of parasite local adaptation been realized. Here we study host-parasite coevolution in a metapopulation model when both the biotic and the abiotic components of the environment vary in space. We provide a general expression for parasite local adaptation that allows local adaptation to be partitioned into the contributions of spatial covariances between host and parasite genotype frequencies within and between habitats. This partitioning clarifies how relative rates of gene flow, spatially variable patterns of selection, and genetic drift interact to shape parasite local adaptation. Specifically, by using this expression in conjunction with coevolutionary models, we show that genetic drift can dramatically increase the level of parasite local adaptation under some models of specificity. We also show that the effect of migration on parasite local adaptation depends on the geographic mosaic of selection. We discuss how these predictions could be tested empirically or experimentally using microbial systems.",

      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation of parasites to their sympatric hosts has been investigated on different biological systems through reciprocal transplant experiments. Most of these studies revealed a local adaptation of the parasite. In several cases, however, parasites were found to be locally maladapted or neither adapted nor maladapted. In the present paper, we try to determine the causes of such variability in these results. We analyse a host\u2013parasite metapopulation model and study the effect of several factors on the emergence of local adaptation: population sizes, mutation rates and migration rates for both the host and the parasite, and parasite generation time. We show that all these factors may act on local adaptation through their effects on the evolutionary potential of each species. In particular, we find that higher numbers of mutants or migrants do, in general, promote local adaptation. Interestingly, shorter parasite generation time does not always favour parasite local adaptation. When genetic variability is limiting, shorter generation time, via an increase of the strength of selection, decreases the capacity of the parasite to adapt to an evolving host.",

      "abstractNote": "Metapopulation dynamics can strongly affect the ecological and evolutionary processes involved in host\u2013parasite interactions. Here, I analyse a deterministic host\u2013parasite coevolutionary model and derive analytic approximations for the level of local adaptation as a function of (1) host migration rate, (2) parasite migration rate, (3) parasite specificity and (4) parasite virulence. This analysis confirms the results of previous simulation studies: the difference between host and parasite migration rates may explain the level of local adaptation of both species. I also show that both higher specificity and higher virulence generally lead to higher levels of local adaptation of the species which is already ahead in the coevolutionary arms race. The present analysis also provides a simple geometric interpretation for local adaptation which captures the complexity of the temporal dynamics of host\u2013parasite coevolution.",

      "abstractNote": "A model is proposed in which niche choice precedes natural selection in an individual's life span; the panmictic population occupies an environment divided into niches, each contributing a constant proportion of parents to the next generation. Niche choice and fitness within the niche are controlled either by the same locus or by two linked loci. The conditions for a protected polymorphism are derived. It is shown that niche preferences can increase the protective effect of natural selection over a polymorphism. This effect depends on the existence of a positive correlation between preference for a niche and relative fitness within that niche, and also on the relative size of the niches. In the absence of within-niche fitness differences, alleles that cause preference for different niches can still be protected. Alleles that determine preference for niches contributing little to the total population can be eliminated by the ability to choose between niches.",

      "abstractNote": "We investigate the interplay between gene flow and adaptation in peripheral populations of a widespread species. Models are developed for the evolution of a quantitative trait under clinally varying selection in a species whose density decreases from the center of the range to its periphery. Two major results emerge. First, gene flow from populations at the range center can be a strong force that inhibits peripheral populations from evolving to their local ecological optima. As a result, peripheral populations experience persistent directional selection. Second, response to local selection pressures can cause rapid and substantial evolution when a peripheral population is isolated from gene flow. The amount of evolutionary change depends on gene flow, selection, the ecological gradient, and the trait's heritability. Rapid divergence can also occur between the two halves of a formerly continuous population that is divided by a vicariant event. A general conclusion is that disruption of gene flow can cause evolutionary divergence, perhaps leading to speciation, in the absence of contributions from random genetic drift.",

      "abstractNote": "Although bubonic plague is an endemic zoonosis in many countries around the world, the factors responsible for the persistence of this highly virulent disease remain poorly known. Classically, the endemic persistence of plague is suspected to be due to the coexistence of plague resistant and plague susceptible rodents in natural foci, and/or to a metapopulation structure of reservoirs. Here, we test separately the effect of each of these factors on the long-term persistence of plague. We analyse the dynamics and equilibria of a model of plague propagation, consistent with plague ecology in Madagascar, a major focus where this disease is endemic since the 1920s in central highlands. By combining deterministic and stochastic analyses of this model, and including sensitivity analyses, we show that (i) endemicity is favoured by intermediate host population sizes, (ii) in large host populations, the presence of resistant rats is sufficient to explain long-term persistence of plague, and (iii) the metapopulation structure of susceptible host populations alone can also account for plague endemicity, thanks to both subdivision and the subsequent reduction in the size of subpopulations, and extinction-recolonization dynamics of the disease. In the light of these results, we suggest scenarios to explain the localized presence of plague in Madagascar.",

Here, we describe and study a stochastic, individual-based, explicit genetic model tailored for this cichlid system. Our results show that relatively rapid (<20,000 generations) colonization of a new ecological niche and (sympatric or parapatric) speciation via local adaptation and divergence in habitat and mating preferences are theoretically plausible if: (i) the number of loci underlying the traits controlling local adaptation, and habitat and mating preferences is small; (ii) the strength of selection for local adaptation is intermediate; (iii) the carrying capacity of the population is intermediate; and (iv) the effects of the loci influencing nonrandom mating are strong. We discuss patterns and timescales of ecological speciation identified by our model, and we highlight important parameters and features that need to be studied empirically to provide information that can be used to improve the biological realism and power of mathematical models of ecological speciation.",

      "abstractNote": "We study victim\u2013exploiter coevolution in a spatially heterogeneous island model. In each species, fitness consequences of between-species interactions are controlled by a single haploid diallelic locus. Our emphasis is on the conditions for the maintenance of genetic variation, the dynamic patterns observed, the extent of local adaptation and genetic differentiation between different demes, and on how different parameters (such as the strength and heterogeneity in selection, migration rates, and the number of sites) affect the dynamic and static behavior of the system. We show that under spatially homogeneous selection the maintenance of genetic variation is possible through asynchronous nonlinear dynamics where the allele frequencies in a majority of demes quickly synchronize but the rest do not. Spatially heterogeneous selection can maintain genetic variation even if migration rates are maximal. This happens in an oscillatory way. Genetic variation is most likely to be maintained at high levels if the heterogeneity in selection is large. If there are some restrictions on migration, genetic variation can be maintained at a stable equilibrium. This behavior is most likely at intermediate migration rates. In this case, the system can exhibit high spatial subdivision as measured by FST values but relatively low local adaptation.",

      "abstractNote": "We consider a simple model of a one-locus, two-allele population inhibiting a two-patch system and experiencing spatially heterogeneous viability selection. The populaton size is finite. We use a diffusion approximation and singular perturbation techniques to find the probability of fixation of a mutant allele. We focus on situations in which each allele is advantageous in one patch and deleterious in the other patch. Our theoretical results support the previous conclusions that, under certain conditions, small populations respond faster to selection than do large populations. We emphasize that knowledge of the dependence of migration rates on population size is crucial in evaluating the effects of population size on the rate of evolution.",

      "abstractNote": "Dobzhansky's model of epistatic selection assumes that viable genotypes form \"clusters\" in genotype space so that populations can evolve from one state to a reproductively isolated state following a \"ridge\" of well-fit genotypes without crossing any deep adaptive valleys. Recently, the importance of Dobzhansky-type models in evolutionary studies has been reemphasized by Gavrilets (1997a) and Gavrilets and Gravner (1997) who argue that the existence of \"ridges\" of well-fit genotypes connecting reproductively isolated genotypes is actually a general property of multidimensional adaptive landscapes. Using rigorous techniques and numerical simulations, I analyze clines in the frequencies of selected and neutral alleles maintained by a balance of migration and Dobzhansky-type epistatic selection acting on two diallelic loci. I show that Dobzhansky-type epistatic selection can build up a very strong barrier to neutral gene flow. I describe properties of clines that are indicative of Dobzhansky-type selection.",

      "abstractNote": "The paper entitled \"Sympatric speciation,\" which was published by John Maynard Smith in 1966, initiated the development of mathematical models aiming to identify the conditions for sympatric speciation. A part of that paper was devoted to a specific two-locus, two-allele model of sympatric speciation in a population occupying a two-niche system. Maynard Smith provided some initial numerical results on this model. Later, Dickinson and Antonovics (1973) and Caisse and Antonovics (1978) performed more extensive numerical studies on the model. Here, I report analytical results on the haploid version of the Maynard Smith model. I show how the conditions for sympatric and parapatric speciation and the levels of resulting genetic divergence and reproductive isolation are affected by the strength of disruptive selection and nonrandom mating, recombination rate, and the rates of male and female dispersal between the niches.",

      "abstractNote": "Theory building is an integral part of biological research, in general, and of speciation research, in particular. Here, I review the modeling work on speciation done in the last 10 years or so, assessing the progress made and identifying areas where additional effort is required. Specific topics considered include evolutionary dynamics of genetic incompatibilities, spatial and temporal patterns of speciation, links to neutral theory of biodiversity, effects of multidimensionality of phenotype, sympatric and parapatric speciation, adaptive radiation, speciation by sexual conflict, and models tailored for specific biological systems. Particularly challenging questions for future theoretical research identified here are 1) incorporating gene regulatory networks in models describing accumulation of genetic incompatibilities; 2) integrating models of community ecology with those developed in speciation theory; 3) building models providing better insights on the dynamics of parapatric speciation; 4) modeling speciation in multidimensional ecological niches with mating preferences based on multidimensional mating cues and sexual characters; 5) linking microevolutionary processes with macroevolutionary patterns as observed in adaptive radiations and paleontological record; 6) modeling speciation in specific systems studied by empirical biologists; and 7) modeling human origins. The insights from dynamic models of speciation should be useful in developing statistical tools that would enable empiricists to infer the history of past evolutionary divergence and speciation from genomic data.",

      "title": "Clines in quantitative traits: The role of migration patterns and selection scenarios",
      "abstractNote": "The existence, uniqueness, and shape of clines in a quantitative trait under selection toward a spatially varying optimum is studied. The focus is on deterministic diploid two-locus n-deme models subject to various migration patterns and selection scenarios. Migration patterns may exhibit isolation by distance, as in the stepping-stone model, or random dispersal, as in the island model. The phenotypic optimum may change abruptly in a single environmental step, more gradually, or not at all. Symmetry assumptions are imposed on phenotypic optima and migration rates. We study clines in the mean, variance, and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Clines result from polymorphic equilibria. The possible equilibrium configurations are determined as functions of the migration rate. Whereas for weak migration, many polymorphic equilibria may be simultaneously stable, their number decreases with increasing migration rate. Also for intermediate migration rates polymorphic equilibria are in general not unique, however, for loci of equal effects the corresponding clines in the mean, variance, and LD are unique. For sufficiently strong migration, no polymorphism is maintained. Both migration pattern and selection scenario exert strong influence on the existence and shape of clines. The results for discrete demes are compared with those from models in which space varies continuously and dispersal is modeled by diffusion. Comparisons with previous studies, which investigated clines under neutrality or under linkage equilibrium, are performed. If there is no long-distance migration, the environment does not change abruptly, and linkage is not very tight, populations are almost everywhere close to linkage equilibrium.",

      "title": "A two-locus model of spatially varying stabilizing or directional selection on a quantitative trait",
      "abstractNote": "The consequences of spatially varying, stabilizing or directional selection on a quantitative trait in a subdivided population are studied. A deterministic two-locus two-deme model is employed to explore the effects of migration, the degree of divergent selection, and the genetic architecture, i.e., the recombination rate and ratio of locus effects, on the maintenance of genetic variation. The possible equilibrium configurations are determined as functions of the migration rate. They depend crucially on the strength of divergent selection and the genetic architecture. The maximum migration rates are investigated below which a stable fully polymorphic equilibrium or a stable single-locus polymorphism can exist. Under stabilizing selection, but with different optima in the demes, strong recombination may facilitate the maintenance of polymorphism. However usually, and in particular with directional selection in opposite direction, the critical migration rates are maximized by a concentrated genetic architecture, i.e., by a major locus and a tightly linked minor one. Thus, complementing previous work on the evolution of genetic architectures in subdivided populations subject to diversifying selection, it is shown that concentrated architectures may aid the maintenance of polymorphism. Conditions are obtained when this is the case. Finally, the dependence of the phenotypic variance, linkage disequilibrium, and various measures of local adaptation and differentiation on the parameters is elaborated.",

      "abstractNote": "The biotic and abiotic factors that facilitate or hinder species range expansions are many and complex. We examine the impact of two genetic processes and their interaction on fitness at expanding range edges: local maladaptation resulting from the presence of an environmental gradient and expansion load resulting from increased genetic drift at the range edge. Results from spatially explicit simulations indicate that the presence of an environmental gradient during range expansion reduces expansion load; conversely, increasing expansion load allows only locally adapted populations to persist at the range edge. Increased maladaptation reduces the speed of range expansion, resulting in less genetic drift at the expanding front and more immigration from the range center, therefore reducing expansion load at the range edge. These results may have ramifications for species being forced to shift their ranges because of climate change or other anthropogenic changes. If rapidly changing climate leads to faster expansion as populations track their shifting climatic optima, populations may suffer increased expansion load beyond previous expectations.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper the consequences of natural selection acting on several loci simultaneously in a spatially fluctuating environment are described. The fitnesses of the genotypes are assumed to be additive both within and between loci. The environment is assumed to be made up of a very large (effectively infinite) number of patches in which fitnesses are assigned at random. The resulting deterministic model is called a Random Levene Model and its properties are approximated by a system of differential equations. The main equilibrium properties are that (1) the linkage disequilibrium is zero and (2) the correlations in fitnesses between alleles at different loci are the principle determinants of the dynamic inter-locus interactions. Although there is no epistasis as conventionally defined, the equilibrium state at the two loci are highly interdependent, the governing principle being that two alleles at different loci whose fitness are negatively correlated across environments have a higher overall fitness due to the reduction in their variance in fitness through the negative correlation. When a large number of loci are considered, they naturally fall into correlation groupings which lead to an enhanced likelihood for polymorphism over that predicted by single-locus theory.",

      "abstractNote": "Novel pathogen introduction can have drastic consequences for naive host populations, and outcomes can be difficult to predict. Evolutionary rescue (ER) provides a foundation for understanding whether hosts are driven to extinction or survive via adaptation. Currently, patterns of host population dynamics alongside evidence of adaptation are used to infer ER. However, the gap between established ER theory and complexity inherent in natural systems makes interpreting empirical patterns difficult because they can be confounded with ecological drivers of survival under current theory. To bridge this gap, we expand ER theory to include biological selective agents, such as pathogens. We find birth processes to be more important than previously theorised in determining ER potential. We employ a novel framework evaluating ER potential within natural systems and gain ability to identify system characteristics that make ER possible. Identifying these characteristics allows a shift from retrospective observation to a predictive mindset, and our findings suggest that ER occurrence may be more limited than previously thought. We use the plague system of Yersinia pestis infecting Cynomys ludovicianus (black-tailed prairie dogs) and Spermophilus beecheyi (California ground squirrels) as a case study.",

      "title": "Maintenance of Polygenic Variation in Spatially Structured Populations: Roles for Local Mating and Genetic Redundancy",
      "abstractNote": "Although heritable genetic variation is critical to the evolutionary process, we know little about how it is maintained. Obviously, mutation-selection balance must play a role, but there is considerable doubt over whether it can account for heritabilities as high as 0.5, which are commonly found in natural populations. Most models of mutation-selection balance assume panmictic populations. In this paper we use Monte Carlo simulations to examine the effect of isolation by distance on the variation maintained by mutation in a polygenic trait subject to optimizing selection. We show that isolation by distance can substantially increase the total variation maintained in continuous populations over a wide range of dispersal patterns, but only if more than one genotype produces the optimal phenotype (genetic redundancy). Isolation by distance alone has only a slight effect on the variation maintained in the total population for neutral alleles. The combined effect of isolation by distance and genetic redundancy, however, allows the maintenance of substantial variation despite strong stabilizing selection. The mechanism is straightforward. Isolation by distance allows mutation and drift to operate independently in different parts of the population. Because of their independent evolutionary histories, different parts of the population independently draw from the available set of redundant genotypes. Because the genotypes are redundant, selection does not discriminate among them, and they will persist until eliminated by drift. The population as a whole maintains many distinct genotypes. We show that this process allows mutation to maintain high levels of variation, even under strong stabilizing selection, and that over a moderate range of dispersal patterns the amount of variation maintained in the entire population is independent of both the strength of selection and the variance of the dispersal distance. Furthermore, we show that individual heterozygosity is increased in locally mating populations when selection is strong. Finally, our simulations provide a rough picture of how selection and the dispersal pattern influence the spatial distribution of genetic and phenotypic variation.",

      "abstractNote": "We examine the effects of density dependence and immigration on local adaptation in a \"black-hole sink\" habitat, i.e., a habitat in which isolated populations of a species would tend to extinction but where a population is demographically maintained by recurrent one-way migration from a separate source habitat in which the species persists. Using a diploid, one-locus model of a discrete-generation sink population maintained by immigration from a fixed source population, we show that a locally favored allele will spread when rare in the sink if the absolute fitness (or, in some cases, the geometric-mean absolute fitness) of heterozygotes with the favored allele is above one in the sink habitat. With density dependence, the criterion for spread can depend on the rate of immigration, because immigration affects local densities and, hence, absolute fitness. Given the successful establishment of a locally favored allele, it will be maintained by a migration-selection balance and the resulting polymorphic population will be sustained deterministically with either stable or unstable dynamics. The densities of stable polymorphic populations tend to exceed densities that would be maintained in the absence of the favored allele. With strong density regulation, spread of the favored allele may destabilize population dynamics. Our analyses show that polymorphic populations which form subsequent to the establishment of favorable alleles have the capacity to persist deterministically without immigration. Finally, we examined the probabilistic rate at which new favored alleles arise and become established in a sink population. Our results suggest that favored alleles are established most readily at intermediate levels of immigration.",

      "title": "How do natural and sexual selection contribute to sympatric speciation?",
      "abstractNote": "I use explicit genetic models to investigate the importance of natural and sexual selection during sympatric speciation and to sort out how genetic architecture influences these processes. Assortative mating alone can lead to speciation, but rare phenotypes\u2019 disadvantage in finding mates and intermediate phenotypes\u2019 advantage due to stabilizing selection strongly impede speciation. Any increase in the number of loci also decreases the likelihood of speciation. Sympatric speciation is then harder to achieve than previously demonstrated by many theoretical studies which assume no mating disadvantage for rare phenotypes and consider a small number of loci. However, when a high level of assortative mating evolves, sexual selection might allow populations to split into dimorphic distributions with peaks corresponding to nearly extreme phenotypes. Competition then works against speciation by favouring intermediate phenotypes and preventing further divergence. The interplay between natural and sexual selection during speciation is then more complex than previously explained.",

      "abstractNote": "The study of parasite local adaptation, whereby parasites perform better on sympatric hosts than on allopatric hosts and/or better on their own host population than do other parasites, is of great importance to both basic and applied biology. Theoretical examination of host\u2013parasite coevolution predicts that parasite migration rate, generation time and virulence all contribute to the pattern of parasite local adaptation, such that parasites with greater dispersal ability, more frequent reproduction and/or high virulence ought to exhibit increased infectivity on local hosts. Here, we present a meta-analysis of experimental work from 57 host\u2013parasite systems across 54 local adaptation studies to directly test theoretical predictions concerning the effect of each attribute on parasite adaptation. As expected, we find that studies of parasites with higher migration rates than their hosts report local adaptation, as measured by infection success, significantly more often than studies of parasites with relatively low migration rates. Furthermore, this synthesis serves to identify biases in the current body of work and highlight areas with the greatest need for further study. We emphasize the importance of unifying the field with regard to experimental methods, local adaptation definitions and reported statistics for cross-infection studies.",

We provide researchers with a roadmap to plan aquatic landscape genomics projects by aggregating spatial and software resources and offering recommendations from sampling to data production and analyses, while cautioning against analytical pitfalls. Given the unique properties of water, we discuss the importance of considering freshwater system structure and marine abiotic properties when assessing genetic diversity, population connectivity, and signals of natural selection.

      "abstractNote": "With the genetic health of many plant and animal populations deteriorating due to climate change outpacing adaptation, interventions, such as assisted gene flow (AGF), may provide genetic variation necessary for populations to adapt to climate change. We ran genetic simulations to mimic different AGF scenarios in large populations and measured their outcomes on population-level fitness to determine circumstances in which it is worthwhile to perform AGF. In the absence of inbreeding depression, AGF was beneficial within a few generations only when introduced genotypes had much higher fitness than local individuals and traits affecting fitness were controlled by a few genes of large effect. AGF was harmful over short periods (e.g., first \u223c10\u201320 generations) if there was strong outbreeding depression or introduced deleterious genetic variation. When the adaptive trait was controlled by many loci of small effect, the benefits of AGF took over 10 generations to realize\u2014potentially too long for most climate-related management scenarios. The genomic integrity of the recipient population typically remained intact following AGF; the amount of genetic material from the donor population usually constituted no more of the recipient population's genome than the fraction of the population introduced. Significant genomic turnover (e.g., >50% replacement) only occurred when the selective advantage of the adaptive trait and translocation fraction were extremely high. Our results will be useful when adaptive management is used to maintain the genetic health and productivity of large populations under climate change.",

Under a continent\u2013island model, a fusion spreads and reaches a polymorphic equilibrium when it causes recombination between locally adapted alleles to be less than their selective advantage. In contrast, fusions in a two-deme model always spread; whether it reaches a polymorphic equilibrium or becomes fixed depends on the relative recombination rates of fused homozygotes and heterozygotes. Neutral divergence around fusion polymorphisms is markedly increased, showing peaks at the point of fusion and at the locally adapted loci. Local adaptation could explain the evolution of many of chromosome fusions, which are some of the most common chromosome rearrangements in nature.",

      "abstractNote": "Genetically correlated traits are known to respond to indirect selection pressures caused by directional selection on other traits. It is however unclear how local adaptation in populations diverging along some phenotypic traits but not others is affected by the joint action of gene flow and genetic correlations among traits. This simulation study shows that although gene flow is a potent constraining mechanism of population adaptive divergence, it may induce phenotypic divergence in traits under homogeneous selection among habitats if they are genetically correlated with traits under divergent selection. This correlated phenotypic divergence is a nonmonotonous function of migration and increases with mutational correlation among traits. It also increases with the number of divergently selected traits provided their genetic autonomy relative to the uniformly selected trait is reduced by specific patterns of genetic covariances: populations with lower effective trait dimensionality are more likely to generate very large correlated divergence. The correlated divergence is likely to be picked up by QST\u2212FST analysis of population genetic differentiation and be erroneously ascribed to adaptive divergence under divergent selection. This study emphasizes the necessity to understand the interaction between selection and the genetic basis of adaptation in a multivariate rather than univariate context.",

      "abstractNote": "Genomic regions (or loci) displaying outstanding correlation with some environmental variables are likely to be under selection and this is the rationale of recent methods of identifying selected loci and retrieving functional information about them. To be efficient, such methods need to be able to disentangle the potential effect of environmental variables from the confounding effect of population history. For the routine analysis of genome-wide datasets, one also needs fast inference and model selection algorithms. We propose a method based on an explicit spatial model which is an instance of spatial generalized linear mixed model (SGLMM). For inference, we make use of the INLA\u2013SPDE theoretical and computational framework developed by Rue et\u00a0al. (2009) and Lindgren et\u00a0al. (2011). The method we propose allows one to quantify the correlation between genotypes and environmental variables. It works for the most common types of genetic markers, obtained either at the individual or at the population level. Analyzing the simulated data produced under a geostatistical model then under an explicit model of selection, we show that the method is efficient. We also re-analyze a dataset relative to nineteen pine weevils (Hylobius abietis) populations across Europe. The method proposed appears also as a statistically sound alternative to the Mantel tests for testing the association between the genetic and environmental variables.",

      "title": "Robust Identification of Local Adaptation from Allele Frequencies",
      "abstractNote": "Comparing allele frequencies among populations that differ in environment has long been a tool for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. However, such analyses are complicated by an imperfect knowledge of population allele frequencies and neutral correlations of allele frequencies among populations due to shared population history and gene flow. Here we develop a set of methods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns and correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies while accounting for these complications based on a Bayesian model previously implemented in the software Bayenv. Using this model, we calculate a set of \u201cstandardized allele frequencies\u201d that allows investigators to apply tests of their choice to multiple populations while accounting for sampling and covariance due to population history. We illustrate this first by showing that these standardized frequencies can be used to detect nonparametric correlations with environmental variables; these correlations are also less prone to spurious results due to outlier populations. We then demonstrate how these standardized allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to detect SNPs that deviate strongly from neutral population structure. This test is conceptually related to FST and is shown to be more powerful, as we account for population history. We also extend the model to next-generation sequencing of population pools\u2014a cost-efficient way to estimate population allele frequencies, but one that introduces an additional level of sampling noise. The utility of these methods is demonstrated in simulations and by reanalyzing human SNP data from the Human Genome Diversity Panel populations and pooled next-generation sequencing data from Atlantic herring. An implementation of our method is available from http://gcbias.org.",

      "abstractNote": "Numerous theoretical and experimental studies have investigated antagonistic co-evolution between parasites and their hosts. Although experimental tests of theory from a range of biological systems are largely concordant regarding the influence of several driving processes, we know little as to how mechanisms acting at the smallest scales (individual molecular and phenotypic changes) may result in the emergence of structures at larger scales, such as co-evolutionary dynamics and local adaptation. We capitalized on methods commonly employed in community ecology to quantify how the structure of community interaction matrices, so-called bipartite networks, reflected observed co-evolutionary dynamics, and how phages from these communities may or may not have adapted locally to their bacterial hosts. We found a consistent nested network structure for two phage types, one previously demonstrated to exhibit arms race co-evolutionary dynamics and the other fluctuating co-evolutionary dynamics. Both phages increased their host ranges through evolutionary time, but we found no evidence for a trade-off with impact on bacteria. Finally, only bacteria from the arms race phage showed local adaptation, and we provide preliminary evidence that these bacteria underwent (sometimes different) molecular changes in the wzy gene associated with the LPS receptor, while bacteria co-evolving with the fluctuating selection phage did not show local adaptation and had partial deletions of the pilF gene associated with type IV pili. We conclude that the structure of phage-bacteria interaction networks is not necessarily specific to co-evolutionary dynamics, and discuss hypotheses for why only one of the two phages was, nevertheless, locally adapted.",

In this work we study the implications of this phenomenon to the problem of adaptation and speciation on a rugged adaptive landscape. One consequence of fitness-associated dispersal (FAD) is that individuals with high fitness are more likely to experience inbreeding, especially with other fit individuals. Another consequence is that when dispersal is costly, the less fit individuals are more likely to pay the cost. When a rare and advantageous allelic combination appears, FAD may increase its chances to spread in the population. In a two-locus two-alleles model with negative epistasis, we find that FAD significantly shortens the waiting time for an adaptive peak shift in comparison with random dispersal.",

      "abstractNote": "The distribution of phenotypes in space will be a compromise between adaptive plasticity and local adaptation increasing the fit of phenotypes to local conditions and gene flow reducing that fit. Theoretical models on the evolution of quantitative characters on spatially explicit landscapes have only considered scenarios where optimum trait values change as deterministic functions of space. Here, these models are extended to include stochastic spatially autocorrelated aspects to the environment, and consequently the optimal phenotype. Under these conditions, the regression of phenotype on the environmental variable becomes steeper as the spatial scale on which populations are sampled becomes larger. Under certain deterministic models \u2013 such as linear clines \u2013 the regression is constant. The way in which the regression changes with spatial scale is informative about the degree of phenotypic plasticity, the relative scale of effective gene flow and the environmental dependency of selection. Connections to temporal models are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "We present a general model for the effect of sex linkage on the evolution of reinforcement of mating preferences on an island. We find that the level of reinforcement can vary up to 80% depending on the mode of inheritance of the female preference and male trait. When reinforcement is driven mainly by selection in the male trait and intrinsic hybrid incompatibilities are weak, sex-linked preferences and autosomal male traits are the most conducive to reinforcement, whereas autosomal preferences and X-linked traits are the least. Surprisingly, the effect of mode of inheritance on reinforcement is poorly predicted by its effect on the genetic correlation between the male trait and female preference. Sex-linkage of genetic incompatibility loci increases reinforcement, though this is not due solely to the occurrence of Haldane's rule. We find that reinforcement can lead to complete reproductive isolation in some cases but not others and that the mode of inheritance can determine which outcome occurs.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding how a diversity of plants in agroecosystems affects the adaptation of pathogens is a key issue in agroecology. We analyze PDE systems describing the dynamics of adaptation of two phenotypically structured populations, under the effects of mutation, selection and migration in a two-patch environment, each patch being associated with a different phenotypic optimum. We consider two types of growth functions that depend on the n-dimensional phenotypic trait: either local and linear or nonlocal nonlinear. In both cases, we obtain existence and uniqueness results as well as a characterization of the large-time behaviour of the solution (persistence or extinction) based on the sign of a principal eigenvalue. We show that migration between the two environments decreases the chances of persistence, with in some cases a \u2018lethal migration threshold\u2019 above which persistence is not possible. Comparison with stochastic individual-based simulations shows that the PDE approach accurately captures this threshold. Our results illustrate the importance of cultivar mixtures for disease prevention and control.",

      "abstractNote": "Many species\u2019 range limits (RL) occur across continuous environmental gradients without obvious barriers imposing them. Such RL are expected to reflect niche limits (NL) and thus to occur where populations cease to be self-sustaining. Transplant experiments comparing fitness within and beyond species\u2019 ranges can test this hypothesis, but interpretive power depends strongly on experimental design. We first identify often overlooked aspects of transplant design that are critical to establishing the causes of RL, especially incorporating transplant sites at, and source populations from, the range edge. We then conduct a meta-analysis of published beyond-range transplant experiments ( tests). Most tests (75%) found that performance declined beyond the range, with the strongest declines detected when the measure of performance was lifetime fitness (83%), suggesting that RL commonly involve niche constraints (declining habitat quality). However, only 46% supported range limits occurring at NL; 26% (mostly geographic RL) fell short of NL with self-sustaining transplants beyond the range, and 23% (all elevational RL) exceeded NL with range-edge populations acting as demographic sinks. These data suggest an important but divergent role for dispersal, which may commonly constrain geographic distributions while extending elevational limits. Meta-analysis results also supported the importance of biotic interactions at RL, particularly the long-held assertion of their role in causing low-elevation and equatorial limits.",

      "abstractNote": "Dispersal ability will largely determine whether species track their climatic niches during climate change, a process especially important for populations at contracting (low-latitude/low-elevation) range limits that otherwise risk extinction. We investigate whether dispersal evolution at contracting range limits is facilitated by two processes that potentially enable edge populations to experience and adjust to the effects of climate deterioration before they cause extinction: (i) climate-induced fitness declines towards range limits and (ii) local adaptation to a shifting climate gradient. We simulate a species distributed continuously along a temperature gradient using a spatially explicit, individual-based model. We compare range-wide dispersal evolution during climate stability vs. directional climate change, with uniform fitness vs. fitness that declines towards range limits (RLs), and for a single climate genotype vs. multiple genotypes locally adapted to temperature. During climate stability, dispersal decreased towards RLs when fitness was uniform, but increased when fitness declined towards RLs, due to highly dispersive genotypes maintaining sink populations at RLs, increased kin selection in smaller populations, and an emergent fitness asymmetry that favoured dispersal in low-quality habitat. However, this initial dispersal advantage at low-fitness RLs did not facilitate climate tracking, as it was outweighed by an increased probability of extinction. Locally adapted genotypes benefited from staying close to their climate optima; this selected against dispersal under stable climates but for increased dispersal throughout shifting ranges, compared to cases without local adaptation. Dispersal increased at expanding RLs in most scenarios, but only increased at the range centre and contracting RLs given local adaptation to climate.",

      "title": "Evolution of migration rate in a spatially realistic metapopulation model",
      "abstractNote": "We use an individual-based, spatially realistic metapopulation model to study the evolution of migration rate. We first explore the consequences of habitat change in hypothetical patch networks on a regular lattice. If the primary consequence of habitat change is an increase in local extinction risk as a result of decreased local population sizes, migration rate increases. A nonmonotonic response, with migration rate decreasing at high extinction rate, was obtained only by assuming very frequent catastrophes. If the quality of the matrix habitat deteriorates, leading to increased mortality during migration, the evolutionary response is more complex. As long as habitat patch occupancy does not decrease markedly with increased migration mortality, reduced migration rate evolves. However, once mortality becomes so high that empty patches remain uncolonized for a long time, evolution tends to increase migration rate, which may lead to an \"evolutionary rescue\" in a fragmented landscape. Kin competition has a quantitative effect on the evolution of migration rate in our model, but these patterns in the evolution of migration rate appear to be primarily caused by spatiotemporal variation in fitness and mortality during migration. We apply the model to real habitat patch networks occupied by two checkerspot butterfly (Melitaea) species, for which sufficient data are available to estimate rigorously most of the model parameters. The model-predicted migration rate is not significantly different from the empirically observed one. Regional variation in patch areas and connectivities leads to regional variation in the optimal migration rate, predictions that can be tested empirically.",

      "abstractNote": "Empirical tests for the importance of population mixing in constraining adaptive divergence have not been well grounded in theory for quantitative traits in spatially discrete populations. We develop quantitative-genetic models to examine the equilibrium difference between two populations that are experiencing different selective regimes and exchanging individuals. These models demonstrate that adaptive divergence is negatively correlated with the rate of population mixing (m, most strongly so when m is low), positively correlated with the difference in phenotypic optima between populations, and positively correlated with the amount of additive genetic variance (G, most strongly so when G is low). The approach to equilibrium is quite rapid (fewer than 50 generations for two populations to evolve 90% of the distance to equilibrium) when either heritability or mixing are not too low (h2 > 0.2 or m > 0.05). The theory can be used to aid empirical tests that: (1) compare observed divergence to that predicted using estimates of population mixing, additive genetic variance/covariance, and selection; (2) test for a negative correlation between population mixing and adaptive divergence across multiple independent population pairs; and (3) experimentally manipulate the rate of mixing. Application of the first two of these approaches to data from two well-studied natural systems suggests that population mixing has constrained adaptive divergence for color patterns in Lake Erie water snakes (Nerodia sipedon), but not for trophic traits in sympatric pairs of benthic and limnetic stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). The theoretical framework we outline should provide an improved basis for future empirical tests of the role of population mixing in adaptive divergence.",

      "abstractNote": "Dispersal has long been recognized as a mechanism that shapes many observed ecological and evolutionary processes. Thus, understanding the factors that promote its evolution remains a major goal in evolutionary ecology. Landscape connectivity may mediate the trade-off between the forces in favour of dispersal propensity (e.g. kin-competition, local extinction probability) and those against it (e.g. energetic or survival costs of dispersal). It remains, however, an open question how differing degrees of landscape connectivity may select for different dispersal strategies. We implemented an individual-based model to study the evolution of dispersal on landscapes that differed in the variance of connectivity across patches ranging from networks with all patches equally connected to highly heterogeneous networks. The parthenogenetic individuals dispersed based on a flexible logistic function of local abundance. Our results suggest, all else being equal, that landscapes differing in their connectivity patterns will select for different dispersal strategies and that these strategies confer a long-term fitness advantage to individuals at the regional scale. The strength of the selection will, however, vary across network types, being stronger on heterogeneous landscapes compared with the ones where all patches have equal connectivity. Our findings highlight how landscape connectivity can determine the evolution of dispersal strategies, which in turn affects how we think about important ecological dynamics such as metapopulation persistence and range expansion.",

      "abstractNote": "The long history of reciprocal transplant studies testing the hypothesis of local adaptation has shown that populations are often adapted to their local environments. Yet many studies have not demonstrated local adaptation, suggesting that sometimes native populations are no better adapted than are genotypes from foreign environments. Local adaptation may also lead to trade-offs, in which adaptation to one environment comes at a cost of adaptation to another environment. I conducted a survey of published studies of local adaptation to quantify its frequency and magnitude and the costs associated with local adaptation. I also quantified the relationship between local adaptation and environmental differences and the relationship between local adaptation and phenotypic divergence. The overall frequency of local adaptation was 0.71, and the magnitude of the native population advantage in relative fitness was 45%. Divergence between home site environments was positively associated with the magnitude of local adaptation, but phenotypic divergence was not. I found a small negative correlation between a population's relative fitness in its native environment and its fitness in a foreign environment, indicating weak trade-offs associated with local adaptation. These results suggest that populations are often locally adapted but stochastic processes such as genetic drift may limit the efficacy of divergent selection.",

      "abstractNote": "Evolutionary dynamics on graphs can lead to many interesting and counterintuitive findings. We study the Moran process, a discrete time birth\u2013death process, that describes the invasion of a mutant type into a population of wild-type individuals. Remarkably, the fixation probability of a single mutant is the same on all regular networks. But non-regular networks can increase or decrease the fixation probability. While the time until fixation formally depends on the same transition probabilities as the fixation probabilities, there is no obvious relation between them. For example, an amplifier of selection, which increases the fixation probability and thus decreases the number of mutations needed until one of them is successful, can at the same time slow down the process of fixation. Based on small networks, we show analytically that (i) the time to fixation can decrease when links are removed from the network and (ii) the node providing the best starting conditions in terms of the shortest fixation time depends on the fitness of the mutant. Our results are obtained analytically on small networks, but numerical simulations show that they are qualitatively valid even in much larger populations.",

      "abstractNote": "Uncovering the genetic and evolutionary basis of local adaptation is a major focus of evolutionary biology. The recent development of cost-effective methods for obtaining high-quality genome-scale data makes it possible to identify some of the loci responsible for adaptive differences among populations. Two basic approaches for identifying putatively locally adaptive loci have been developed and are broadly used: one that identifies loci with unusually high genetic differentiation among populations (differentiation outlier methods) and one that searches for correlations between local population allele frequencies and local environments (genetic-environment association methods). Here, we review the promises and challenges of these genome scan methods, including correcting for the confounding influence of a species\u2019 demographic history, biases caused by missing aspects of the genome, matching scales of environmental data with population structure, and other statistical considerations. In each case, we make suggestions for best practices for maximizing the accuracy and efficiency of genome scans to detect the underlying genetic basis of local adaptation. With attention to their current limitations, genome scan methods can be an important tool in finding the genetic basis of adaptive evolutionary change.",

      "abstractNote": "This study addresses the question of how spatial heterogeneity in prey productivity and migration act to determine geographic patterns in antagonistic coevolution with a predator. We develop and analyze a quantitative coevolutionary model for a predator-prey interaction. If the model is modified appropriately, the results could broadly apply to multispecies communities and to herbivore-plant, parasite-host, and parasitoid-host associations. Model populations are distributed over a gradient in prey birth rate (as a measure of productivity). Each population, in each patch, is made up of a suite of strains. Each strain of the predator has a certain ability to successfully attack each strain of the prey. We consider scenarios of isolated patches, global migration, and stepping-stone (i.e., local) migration over a linear string of patches. The most pervasive patterns are the following: investments in predator offense and prey defense are both maximal in the patches of highest prey productivity; when there are no constraints on maximal investment, mean predation evolves to highest levels in the most productive patches; similarly, the predator has a greater impact (measured as the percentage reduction in prey density) on the prey population in high productivity patches as compared with low productivity ones-in spite (even after evolution) of prey abundance being highest in the most productive patches; and migration has the net effect of shunting relatively offensive and defensive strains from productive patches to nonproductive ones, potentially resulting in the elimination of otherwise rare, low-investment clones. A modification of the model to gene-for-gene type interactions predicts that generalist strains (in terms of the range of strains the predator can exploit or the prey can fend off) dominate in productive areas of the prey, whereas specialists prevail in marginal habitats. Assuming a wide range of productivities over the prey's geographical distribution, the greatest strain diversity should be found in habitats of intermediate productivity. We discuss the implications of our study for adaptation and conservation. Empirical studies are in broad accord with our findings.",

      "abstractNote": "Adaptive divergence among populations can result in local adaptation, whereby genotypes in native environments exhibit greater fitness than genotypes in novel environments. A body of theory has developed that predicts how different species traits, such as rates of gene flow and generation times, influence local adaptation in coevolutionary species interactions. We used a meta-analysis of local-adaptation studies across a broad range of host-parasite interactions to evaluate predictions about the effect of species traits on local adaptation. We also evaluated how experimental design influences the outcome of local adaptation experiments. In reciprocally designed experiments, the relative gene flow rate of hosts versus parasites was the strongest predictor of local adaptation, with significant parasite local adaptation only in the studies in which parasites had greater gene flow rates than their hosts. When nonreciprocal studies were included in analyses, species traits did not explain significant variation in local adaptation, although the overall level of local adaptation observed was lower in the nonreciprocal than in the reciprocal studies. This formal meta-analysis across a diversity of host-parasite systems lends insight into the role of both biology (species traits) and biologists (experimental design) in detecting local adaptation in coevolving species interactions.",

      "abstractNote": "Plasticity in traits in response to environmental conditions can increase fitness, expanding the range of environments within which a genotype can generate viable and productive phenotypes, and therefore when and where populations can persist and diversify in ecological space. Adaptive forms of plasticity in invertebrates are diverse, ranging from polyphenism and diapause to behavioural thermoregulation and optimal foraging. Local patterns of environmental variation and developmental constraints will dictate which of these forms evolves. Here we review the core idea that the use of narrow developmental windows by invertebrates to attain specific types of phenotypic changes reduces their reversibility, while increasing their magnitude. These tradeoffs dictate the costs and effectiveness of plasticity in buffering environmental variation. In particular, plastic responses to narrow developmental or environmental windows increase fitness costs when predicted environmental challenges do not materialise, or when the environment changes in unpredictable ways. We then explore the converse idea that increasing trait reversibility depends on extending the period for which genotypes are sensitive to the environment, but also narrows the range of plastic phenotypes that can be generated. Considering these findings together, we would expect that the costs, benefits and constraints of reversible versus irreversible plasticity affect the rate and magnitude of adaptive responses to rapidly changing and novel environments. However, such predictions have rarely been tested or included in theoretical models. Identifying this knowledge gap leads us to propose new research directions to provide a deeper understanding of the evolution of plasticity in invertebrates and other organisms. We illustrate these possible directions through examples of Drosophila adapting to thermal stress.",

      "abstractNote": "All species have limited distributions at broad geographical scales. At local scales, the distribution of many species is influenced by the interplay of the three factors of habitat availability, local extinctions and colonization dynamics. We use the standard Levins metapopulation model to illustrate how gradients in these three factors can generate species\u2019 range limits. We suggest that the three routes to range limits have radically different evolutionary implications. Because the Levins model makes simplifying assumptions about the spatial coupling of local populations, we present numerical studies of spatially explicit metapopulation models that complement the analytical model. The three routes to range limits give rise to distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Range limits in one species can also arise because of environmental gradients impinging upon other species. We briefly discuss a predator\u2013prey example, which illustrates indirect routes to range limits in a metacommunity context.",

      "abstractNote": "The fundamental niche is a description of the range of environmental conditions in which the mean fitness of a population exceeds or equals unity, and outside of which its mean fitness is less than one. The fundamental niche is a mean phenotype of a population, a trait that can evolve by natural selection. In the analysis of the evolution of adaptations by natural selection one must specify the range of environments within which the relative fitnesses of alternative phenotypes are compared. Population dynamics automatically biases the environments experienced by an evolutionary lineage, simply because more individuals tend to be found within the fundamental niche than outside it (unless the population as a whole is going extinct). We argue that this basic asymmetry biases adaptive evolution toward further improvement to conditions inside the fundamental niche, even at the expense of fitness outside it. This suggests that natural selection may act principally as a conservative force on fundamental niches. We place the particular problem of the evolution of fundamental niches into the general framework of specifying the spatiotemporal scale for the analysis of adaptation in heterogeneous environments and introduce the notion of a \u2018phylogenetic envelope\u2019, a heuristic representation of this scaling. Because all of microevolution necessarily occurs within the constraint of the evolutionary dynamics of the fundamental niche, we conclude that understanding such dynamics should be of central concern to evolutionary ecologists.",

      "abstractNote": "A species' range limits may shift in space either because of changes in ecological factors (e.g. climate, the abundances of interacting species) or because the traits which influence range limits (e.g. dispersal, niche characteristics) evolve by natural selection. In Geographical Ecology, Robert MacArthur (1972) provided a synthesis of the evolutionary factors that may drive range dynamics. In this paper, I revisit this theme in the light of recent theoretical studies of evolution in heterogeneous environments. These studies suggest that a rich range of evolutionary patterns in species' ranges may occur, including expansions or contractions, leading to dynamism in ranges even in epochs without strong directional environmental change.",

      "abstractNote": "Environmental fluctuations are pervasive in nature, but the influence of non-directional temporal variation on range limits has received scant attention. We synthesize insights from the literature and use simple models to make conceptual points about the potentially wide range of ecological and evolutionary effects of temporal variation on range limits. Because organisms respond nonlinearly to environmental conditions, temporal variation can directionally alter long-term growth rates, either to shrink or to expand ranges. We illustrate this diversity of outcomes with a model of competition along a mortality gradient. Temporal variation can permit transitions between alternative states, potentially facilitating range expansion. We show this for variation in dispersal, using simple source-sink population models (with strong Allee effects, or with gene flow hampering local adaptation). Temporal variation enhances extinction risk owing to demographic stochasticity, rare events, and loss of genetic variation, all tending to shrink ranges. However, specific adaptations to exploit variation (including dispersal) may permit larger ranges than in similar but constant environments. Grappling with temporal variation is essential both to understand eco-evolutionary dynamics at range limits and to guide conservation and management strategies. This article is part of the theme issue 'Species' ranges in the face of changing environments (Part II)'.",

      "abstractNote": "The range of potential mechanisms limiting species' distributions in space is nearly as varied and complex as the diversity of life itself. Yet viewed abstractly, a species' border is a geographic manifestation of a species' demographic responses to a spatially and temporally varying world. Population dynamic models provide insight into the different routes by which range limits can arise owing to gradients in demographic rates. In a metapopulation context, for example, range limits may be caused by gradients in extinction rates, colonization rates or habitat availability. We have consider invasion models in uniform and heterogeneous environments as a framework for understanding non-equilibrium range limits, and explore conditions under which invasions may cease to spread leaving behind a stationary range limit. We conclude that non-equilibrial range dynamics need further theoretical and empirical attention.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding range limits is a fundamental problem in ecology and evolutionary biology. In 1963, Mayr argued that \"contaminating\" gene flow from central populations constrained adaptation in marginal populations, preventing range expansion, while in 1984, Bradshaw suggested that absence of genetic variation prevented species from occurring everywhere. Understanding stability of range boundaries requires unraveling the interplay of demography, gene flow, and evolution of populations in concrete landscape settings. We walk through a set of interrelated spatial scenarios that illustrate interesting complexities of this interplay. To motivate our individual-based model results, we consider a hypothetical zooplankter in a landscape of discrete water bodies coupled by dispersal. We examine how patterns of dispersal influence adaptation in sink habitats where conditions are outside the species' niche. The likelihood of observing niche evolution (and thus range expansion) over any given timescale depends on (1) the degree of initial maladaptation; (2) pattern (pulsed vs. continuous, uni- vs. bidirectional), timing (juvenile vs. adult), and rate of dispersal (and hence population size); (3) mutation rate; (4) sexuality; and (5) the degree of heterogeneity in the occupied range. We also show how the genetic architecture of polygenic adaptation is influenced by the interplay of selection and dispersal in heterogeneous landscapes.",

      "abstractNote": "IntroductionA recognition of spatial processes can be found even in the earliest glimmerings of intellectual understanding of the parasitic origin of infectious disease. As described in Ewald (1994a, p. 184), the Renaissance thinker Girolamo Fracastoro hypothesized that disease-specific germs could multiply within a person's body and be transmitted either directly over short distances, or over long distances (e.g., via contaminated objects). In recent years, a number of authors have emphasized how many epidemiological phenomena cannot be understood without explicitly considering infectious processes in a spatial context (e.g., Holmes 1997). There are several general issues that arise automatically when spatial aspects of the dynamics of infectious disease are considered. For instance, if infections are localized, spatial separation increases the degrees of freedom of a host\u2013parasite system, permitting a rich array of dynamical behaviors to arise even in a spatially homogeneous world (e.g., Hassell et al. 1994). Moreover, spatial heterogeneity is the norm rather than the exception in ecological systems (Williamson 1981). Dispersal often couples habitats that differ strongly in local population parameters (e.g., carrying capacity), or involve anisotropic spatial flows. This leads to the potential for asymmetries among habitats in the degree of the impact of spatial coupling on local ecological and evolutionary dynamics.In population ecology, an example of such asymmetries that has received considerable attention in recent years is \u201csource\u2013sink\u201d dynamics.",

      "abstractNote": "Models of the maintenance of genetic variance in a polygenic trait have usually assumed that population size is infinite and that selection is weak. Consequently, they will overestimate the amount of variation maintained in finite populations. I derive approximations for the equilibrium genetic variance, VG in finite populations under weak stabilizing selection for triallelic loci and for an infinite \"rare alleles\" model. These are compared to results for neutral characters, to the \"Gaussian allelic\" model, and to Wright's approximation for a biallelic locus under arbitrary selection pressures. For a variety of parameter values, the three-allele, Gaussian, and Wrightian approximations all converge on the neutral model when population size is small. As expected, far less equilibrium genetic variance can be maintained if effective population size, N, is on the order of a few hundred than if Nis infinite. All of the models predict that comparisons among populations with N less than about 104 should show substantial differences in VG. While it is easier to maintain absolute VG Awhen alleles interact to yield dominance or overdominance for fitness, less additivity also makes VG more susceptible to differences in N. I argue that experimental data do not seem to reflect the predicted degree of relationship between N and VG. This calls into question the ability of mutation-selection balance or simple balancing selection to explain observed VG. The dependence of VG on N could be used to test the adequacy of mutation-selection balance models.",

Taking trees as a model for organisms with undirected, passive dispersal, we have developed an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation tool to investigate the evolution of the dispersal kernel, P (r), and its resulting cumulative seed-density distribution, D (r). Simulations were run on a variety of fractal landscapes differing in the fraction of suitable habitat and the spatial autocorrelation. Starting from a uniform D (r), evolution led to an increase in the fraction of seeds staying in the home cell, a reduction of the dispersal mortality (arrival in unsuitable habitat), and the evolution of \u2018fat-tailed\u2019 D (r) in autocorrelated landscapes and approximately uniform D (r) in random landscapes. The evolutionary process was characterized by long periods of stasis with a few bouts of rapid change in the dispersal rate.",

      "abstractNote": "A dispersal-selection cline model is analysed to evaluate the role of the ratio of pollen to seed flow (r) in spatial genetic variation, with a focus on clines in additive and dominant variances of major genes affecting a quantitative trait, assuming one locus with two alleles, no genetic drift and no mutation. It is shown that under weak selection, steady-state departures from the value at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for genotype frequency (D) and additive variance (DeltaVa) generally display a small value on one side of the selection boundary point, a high value around the point, and a moderate value on the other side of the boundary point. A large value of r can enhance formation of this pattern. However, this is not the case for clines in the average effect of a gene substitution (Deltaalpha) or in dominance variance (DeltaVd), where large values of r can eradicate the clines. Direct use of their values at HWE to approximate the real case is acceptable. There is an expected turning point that divides clines of either additive variance or dominance variance into two subclines, each with a shorter width than that of allele frequency. Integration of these properties can help to indicate the existence of major genes affecting a quantitative trait.",

      "abstractNote": "Previous theories show that tension and ecological zones are indistinguishable in terms of gene frequency clines. Here I analytically show that these two types of zones can be distinguished in terms of genetic statistics other than gene frequency. A two-locus cline model is examined with the assumptions of random mating, weak selection, no drift, no mutation, and multiplicative viabilities. The genetic statistics for distinguishing the two types of zones are the deviations of one- or two-locus genotypic frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) or from random association of gametes (RAG), and the deviations of additive and dominance variances from the values at HWE. These deviations have a discontinuous distribution in space and different extents of interruptions in the ecological zone with a sharp boundary, but exhibit a continuous distribution in the tension zone. Linkage disequilibrium enhances the difference between the deviations from HWE and from RAG for any two-locus genotypic frequency.",

      "abstractNote": "Global change threatens plant diversity and disrupts its interrelationship with ecosystem structure and function. This disruption in turn undermines confidence in the knowledge ecologists produce, and whether it will translate into multidisciplinary research settings or guide the effective management of natural lands. To address this challenge, ecology needs to consider the interactions between different levels of biological hierarchy, especially how they feedback on, and are mediated by, plant diversity. Doing so will require conducting empirical work and developing theory that simultaneously considers multiple disciplinary perspectives and units of study. Here we advocate the use of common gardens to integrate ecology, evolutionary biology and ecosystem science through an explicit focus on simultaneous measurement of response variables at multiple levels of biological organization. This approach will provide opportunities to evaluate assumptions important to prediction, such as space-for-time substitution, and tackle the integration of physicochemical and eco-evolutionary foundations to understanding plants and ecosystems. Synthesis. We summarize the large body of research on Sonoran Desert winter annuals to demonstrate how experimental designs that employ common gardens to integrate processes across scales hold special promise. This includes refining trait-based theories of plant strategies, providing insight into ecosystem responses to global change and collaborating effectively with other scientific disciplines.",

      "title": "Reciprocal transplant gardens as gold standard to detect local adaptation in grassland species: New opportunities moving into the 21st century",
      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation is a fundamental phenomenon in evolutionary biology, with relevance to formation of ecotypes, and ultimately new species, and application to restoration and species\u2019 response to climate change. Reciprocal transplant gardens, a common garden in which ecotypes are planted among home and away habitats, are the gold standard to detect local adaptation in populations. This review focuses on reciprocal transplant gardens to detect local adaptation, especially in grassland species beginning with early seminal studies of grass ecotypes. Fast forward more than half a century, reciprocal gardens have moved into the genomic era, in which the genetic underpinnings of ecotypic variation can now be uncovered. Opportunities to combine genomic and reciprocal garden approaches offer great potential to shed light on genetic and environmental control of phenotypic variation. Our decadal study of adaptation in a dominant grass across the precipitation gradient of the US Great Plains combined genomic approaches and realistic community settings to shed light on controls over phenotype. Common gardens are not without limitations and challenges. A survey of recent studies indicated the modal study uses a tree species, three source sites and one growing site, focuses on one species growing in a monoculture, lasts 3 years, and does not use other experimental manipulations and rarely employs population genetic tools. Reciprocal transplant gardens are even more uncommon, accounting for only 39% of the studies in the literature survey with the rest occurring at a single common site. Reciprocal transplant gardens offer powerful windows into local adaptation when (a) placed across wide environmental gradients to encompass the species\u2019 range; (b) conducted across timespans adequate for detecting responses; (c) employing selection studies among competing ecotypes in community settings and (d) combined with measurements of form and function which ultimately determine success in home and away environments. Synthesis. Reciprocal transplant gardens have been one of the foundations in evolutionary biology for the study of adaptation for the last century, and even longer in Europe. Moving forward, reciprocal gardens of foundational non-model species, combined with genomic analyses and incorporation of biotic factors, have the potential to further revolutionize evolutionary biology. These field experiments will help to predict and model response to climate change and inform restoration practices.",

      "abstractNote": "The detection of adaptive loci in the genome is essential as it gives the possibility of understanding what proportion of a genome or which genes are being shaped by natural selection. Several statistical methods have been developed which make use of molecular data to reveal genomic regions under selection. In this paper, we propose an approach to address this issue from the environmental angle, in order to complement results obtained by population genetics. We introduce a new method to detect signatures of natural selection based on the application of spatial analysis, with the contribution of geographical information systems (GIS), environmental variables and molecular data. Multiple univariate logistic regressions were carried out to test for association between allelic frequencies at marker loci and environmental variables. This spatial analysis method (SAM) is similar to current population genomics approaches since it is designed to scan hundreds of markers to assess a putative association with hundreds of environmental variables. Here, by application to studies of pine weevils and breeds of sheep we demonstrate a strong correspondence between SAM results and those obtained using population genetics approaches. Statistical signals were found that associate loci with environmental parameters, and these loci behave atypically in comparison with the theoretical distribution for neutral loci. The contribution of this new tool is not only to permit the identification of loci under selection but also to establish hypotheses about ecological factors that could exert the selection pressure responsible. In the future, such an approach may accelerate the process of hunting for functional genes at the population level.",

      "abstractNote": "In host-parasite coevolutionary arms races, parasites probably have an evolutionary advantage. Parasite populations should be locally adapted, having higher mean fitness on sympatric than allopatric hosts. Here we assess evidence for local parasite advantage. Further we investigate how adaptation and counter-adaptation of parasites and hosts, necessarily occurring in sympatry, can generate a pattern of local adaptation. Already simple frequency-dependent selection models generate complex patterns of parasite performance on sympatric and allopatric populations. In metapopulations, with extinction, recolonization, and gene flow, variable selection pressure and stochasticity may obscure local processes or change the level at which local adaptation occurs. Alternatively, gene flow may introduce adaptive variation, so differential migration rates can modify the asymmetry of host and parasite evolutionary rates. We conclude that local adaptation is an average phenomenon. Its detection requires adequate replication at the appropriate level, that at which the local processes occur.",

      "abstractNote": "The mechanisms that facilitate success of an invasive species include both ecological and evolutionary processes. Investigating the evolutionary dynamics of founder populations can enhance our understanding of patterns of invasiveness and provide insight into management strategies for controlling further establishment of introduced populations. Our aim is to analyze the evolutionary consequences of ecological processes (i.e., propagule pressure and threshold density effects) that impact successful colonization. We address our questions using a spatially-explicit modeling approach that incorporates dispersal, density dependent population growth, and selection. Our results show that adaptive evolution may occur in small or sparse populations, providing a means of mitigating or avoiding inverse density dependent effects (i.e., Allee effects). The rate at which this adaptation occurs is proportional to the amount of genetic variance and is a crucial component in assessing whether natural selection can rescue a population from extinction. We provide theoretical evidence for the importance of recognizing evolution in predicting and explaining successful biological invasions.",

      "abstractNote": "The principle that a subdivided population subject to overdominance viability selection in each habitat will manifest a unique, globally attractng polymorphic equilibrium is posited. This follows as a corollary to the stronger principle that, if haploid selection or submultiplicative diploid selection (definition: the geometric mean of the homozygote viabilities is less than or equal to the heterozygote viability) is operating in each habitat,there is a unique, globally attracting stable equilibrium that may be monomorphic or polymorphic. These principles are proven for a broad spectrum of migration patterns. In all such migration selection systems, multiple fixation states cannot be simultaneously stable under submultiplicative viability regimes. Contrasting examples where sub-multiplicative viabilities are not in force are given.",

      "abstractNote": "We propose a new speciation mechanism for hybridizing populations based on frequency-dependent sexual selection theory. In contrast to previous reinforcement and symmetric speciation models, this model does not require viability selection for male sexual traits, selection against unlit hybrids or disruptive selection for ecological traits. The model assumes that females exhibit mating preferences based on male secondary sexual characters. Both female mating preferences and male secondary sexual traits are independent quantitative genetic traits. Females choose using one of five tactics All individuals, including the hybrids, have the same ability to survive and reproduce. Two populations that differ only in their average values of female preference and male sexual traits are assumed to come into contact and hybridize. Most cases of the model frequently result in complete prezygotic isolation. The likelihood of speciation decreases with the degree of phenotypic overlap between the two merging populations. However, the probability of speciation is not zero even when the two merging populations are identical.",

      "abstractNote": "The focus of this paper is the relationship between the dispersal rate and the conditions for invasion of a rare allele that improves performance in a marginal sink habitat at the expense of reducing fitness in the main source habitat. Classic multiple-niche population-genetic models predict that the conditions for the invasion of such an allele always become more favourable as the dispersal rate decreases. Precisely the opposite prediction was reached in demographic fitness-sensitivity studies. This study reconciles those contradictory predictions and identifies the assumptions responsible for the discrepancy. I show that whether a lower dispersal rate makes the conditions for the invasion of the allele more or less stringent depends on the magnitude of the effects of the allele. If the effect is large relative to the degree of maladaptedness of the original genotype to the marginal habitat, the conditions become less stringent with decreasing dispersal rate. The opposite is the case for mutations with very small effects. For a broad range of mutations with intermediate effects the conditions are most stringent under an intermediate dispersal rate.",

They are a paradigm for testing evolutionary hypotheses about traits favoured by particular environmental factors. This paper is an attempt to summarize the conceptual framework for local adaptation studies. We first review theoretical work relevant for local adaptation. Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments designed to detect local adaptation in the pattern of deme \u00d7 habitat interaction for fitness. Finally, we review research questions and approaches to studying the processes of local adaptation \u2013 divergent natural selection, dispersal and gene flow, and other processes affecting adaptive differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted approaches to the study of local adaptation, and stress the need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that promote or hinder local adaptation. Experimental evolution of replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus would be a valuable way to complement research on natural populations.",

      "title": "The evolution of life histories in spatially heterogeneous environments: Optimal reaction norms revisited",
      "abstractNote": "Natural populations live in heterogeneous environments, where habitat variation drives the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. The key feature of population structure addressed in this paper is the net flow of individuals from source (good) to sink (poor) habitats. These movements make it necessary to calculate fitness across the full range of habitats encountered by the population, rather than independently for each habitat. As a consequence, the optimal phenotype in a given habitat not only depends on conditions there but is linked to the performance of individuals in other habitats. We generalize the Euler-Lotka equation to define fitness in a spatially heterogeneous environment in which individuals disperse among habitats as newborn and then stay in a given habitat for life. In this case, maximizing fitness (the rate of increase over all habitats) is equivalent to maximizing the reproductive value of newborn in each habitat but not to maximizing the rate of increase that would result if individuals in each habitat were an isolated population. The new equation can be used to find optimal reaction norms for life history traits, and examples are calculated for age at maturity and clutch size. In contrast to previous results, the optimal reaction norm differs from the line connecting local adaptations of isolated populations each living in only one habitat. Selection pressure is higher in good and frequent habitats than in poor and rare ones. A formula for the relative importance of these two factors allows predictions of the habitat in which the genetic variance about the optimal reaction norm should be smallest.",

      "abstractNote": "In spatially heterogeneous environments, natural selection for maintenance of adaptation to habitats that contribute little to the population's reproduction is weak. In this paper we model a mechanism that can result in loss of fitness in such marginal habitats, and thus lead to specialisation on the main habitat. It involves accumulation of mutations that are deleterious in the marginal habitat but neutral or nearly so in the main habitat (mutations deleterious in the main habitat and neutral in the marginal habitat have a negligible influence). If the contribution of the marginal habitat to total reproduction in the absence of the mutations is less than a threshold value, selection is too weak to counter accumulation of such mutations. A positive feedback then results in loss of fitness in the marginal habitat. This mechanism does not require antagonistic pleiotropy in adaptation to different habitats, although antagonistic pleiotropy facilitates the mutational collapse of fitness in the marginal habitat. We suggest that deleterious mutations with habitat-specific expression may play a role in the evolution of ecological specialisation and promote evolutionary conservatism of ecological niches.",

Yet, little attention has been paid to the role of population differentiation and migration in the evolution of plasticity. A new theoretical analysis by Sultan and Spencer extends the current theory by examining the consequences of migration between subpopulations of a species living in a spatially variable environment. Their results suggest that modest migration between spatially varying subpopulations can greatly expand the conditions in which plasticity is favored.",

We present a model that shows how both processes can cause a species range to expand. Introgression of an inversion that carries novel, locally adapted alleles is a particularly powerful mechanism for range expansion. The model supports the earlier proposal that introgression of an inversion triggered a large range expansion of a malaria mosquito. These results suggest a role for inversions as cassettes of genes that can accelerate adaptation by crossing species boundaries, rather than protecting genomes from introgression.",

      "abstractNote": "We study the evolution of inversions that capture locally adapted alleles when two populations are exchanging migrants or hybridizing. By suppressing recombination between the loci, a new inversion can spread. Neither drift nor coadaptation between the alleles (epistasis) is needed, so this local adaptation mechanism may apply to a broader range of genetic and demographic situations than alternative hypotheses that have been widely discussed. The mechanism can explain many features observed in inversion systems. It will drive an inversion to high frequency if there is no countervailing force, which could explain fixed differences observed between populations and species. An inversion can be stabilized at an intermediate frequency if it also happens to capture one or more deleterious recessive mutations, which could explain polymorphisms that are common in some species. This polymorphism can cycle in frequency with the changing selective advantage of the locally favored alleles. The mechanism can establish underdominant inversions that decrease heterokaryotype fitness by several percent if the cause of fitness loss is structural, while if the cause is genic there is no limit to the strength of underdominance that can result. The mechanism is expected to cause loci responsible for adaptive species-specific differences to map to inversions, as seen in recent QTL studies. We discuss data that support the hypothesis, review other mechanisms for inversion evolution, and suggest possible tests.",

      "abstractNote": "Gene flow from the center of a species' range can stymie adaptation at the periphery and prevent the range from expanding outward. We study this process using simple models that track both demography and the evolution of a quantitative trait in a population that is continuously distributed in space. Stabilizing selection acts on the trait and favors an optimum phenotype that changes linearly across the habitat. One of three outcomes is possible: the species will become extinct, expand to fill all of the available habitat, or be confined to a limited range in which it is sufficiently adapted to allow population growth. When the environment changes rapidly in space, increased migration inhibits local adaptation and so decreases the species' total population size. Gene flow can cause enough maladaptation that the peripheral half of a species' range acts as a demographic sink. The trait's genetic variance has little effect on species persistence or the size of the range when gene flow is sufficiently strong to keep population densities far below the carrying capacity throughout the range, but it can increase the range width and population size of an abundant species. Under some conditions, a small parameter change can dramatically shift the balance between gene flow and local adaptation, allowing a species with a limited range to suddenly expand to fill all the available habitat.",

      "abstractNote": "Traits that cause assortative mating such as the flowering time in plants and body size in animals can produce reproductive isolation between hybridizing populations. Can selection against unfit hybrids cause two populations to diverge in their mean values for these kinds of traits? Here I present a haploid analytical model of one population that receives gene flow from another. The partial pre-zygotic isolation between the two populations is caused by assortative mating for a trait that is influenced by any number of genes with additive effects. The post-zygotic isolation is caused by selection against genetic incompatibilities that can involve any form of selection on individual genes and gene combinations (epistasis). The analysis assumes that the introgression rate and selection coefficients are small. The results show that the assortment trait mean will not diverge from the immigrants unless there is direct selection on the trait favouring it to do so or there are genes of very large effect. The amount of divergence at equilibrium is determined by a balance between direct selection on the assortment trait and introgression from the other population. Additional selection against hybrid genetic incompatibilities reduces the effective migration rate and allows greater divergence. The role of assortment in speciation is discussed in the light of these results.",

      "abstractNote": "We develop a haploid model for the reinforcement of female mating preferences on an island that receives migrants from a continent. We find that preferences will evolve to favor island males under a broad range of conditions: when the average male display trait on the island and continent differ, when the preference acts on that difference, and when there is standing genetic variance for the preference. A difference between the mean display trait on the continent and on the island is sufficient to drive reinforcement of preferences. Additional postzygotic isolation, caused, for example, by either epistatic incompatibility or ecological selection against hybrids, will amplify reinforcement but is not necessary. Under some conditions, the degree of preference reinforcement is a simple function of quantities that can be estimated entirely from phenotypic data. We go on to study how postzygotic isolation caused by epistatic incompatibilities affects reinforcement of the preference. With only one pair of epistatic loci, reinforcement is enhanced by tighter linkage between the preference genes and the genes causing hybrid incompatibility. Reinforcement of the preference is also affected by the number of epistatically interacting genes involved in incompatibility, independent of the overall intensity of selection against hybrids.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent theory has suggested that sympatric speciation can occur quite easily when individuals that are ecologically similar mate assortatively. Although many of these models have assumed that individuals have equal mating success, in nature rare phenotypes may often suffer decreased mating success. Consequently, assortative mating may often generate stabilizing sexual selection. We show that this effect can substantially impede sympatric speciation. Our results emphasize the need for data on the strength of the stabilizing component of selection generated by mating in natural populations.",

      "abstractNote": "A large number of mathematical models have been developed that show how natural and sexual selection can cause prezygotic isolation to evolve. This article attempts to unify this literature by identifying five major elements that determine the outcome of speciation caused by selection: a form of disruptive selection, a form of isolating mechanism (assortment or a mating preference), a way to transmit the force of disruptive selection to the isolating mechanism (direct selection or indirect selection), a genetic basis for increased isolation (a one- or two-allele mechanism), and an initial condition (high or low initial divergence). We show that the geographical context of speciation (allopatry vs. sympatry) can be viewed as a form of assortative mating. These five elements appear to operate largely independently of each other and can be used to make generalizations about when speciation is most likely to happen. This provides a framework for interpreting results from laboratory experiments, which are found to agree generally with theoretical predictions about conditions that are favorable to the evolution of prezygotic isolation.",

In a simple two\u2010patch model, I find many types of locally evolutionarily stable attractors of dispersal and of a trait involved in habitat specialization, including a single habitat specialist and a coalition of two specialists with low dispersal, a generalist with high dispersal, and several types of dispersal polymorphisms. In general, only one attractor is a global evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). In addition to the ESS analysis, I also present some examples of the dynamics of evolution that exhibit adaptive diversification by evolutionary branching.",

      "abstractNote": "Sympatric speciation is studied in population polymorphic in one polygenic character. Individuals with different marginal phenotypes are reproductively isolated. The final stage of speciation is investigated when the number of the forming species greatly exceeds the total number of intermediate individuals, which allowed the set of equations describing our population to be reduced to a set of linear equations. The final stage of speciation appears to be critical and determines the output of the process. The force of disruptive selection necessary to complete the speciation has been found under various conditions (namely, the number of loci, different types of selection, and assortative mating). Our model shows that sympatric speciation is possible under a wide range of quite realistic conditions, which supports the hypothesis about its possibility in nature. Relative frequencies of the intermediate phenotypes containing much information about the main factors of speciation are also found.",

      "abstractNote": "There has recently been considerable debate over the relative importance of selection against hybrids (\"endogenous\" selection) vs. adaptation to different environments (\"exogenous\") in maintaining stable hybrid zones and hence in speciation. Single-locus models of endogenous and exogenous viability selection generate clines of similar shape, but the comparison has not been extended to multilocus systems, which are both quantitatively and qualitatively very different from the single-locus case. Here we develop an analytical multilocus model of differential adaptation across an environmental transition and compare it to previous heterozygote disadvantage models. We show that the shape of clines generated by exogenous selection is indistinguishable from that generated by endogenous selection. A stochastic simulation model is used to test the robustness of the analytical description to the effects of drift and strong selection, and confirms the prediction that pairwise linkage disequilibria are predominantly generated by migration. However, although analytical predictions for the width of clines maintained by heterozygote disadvantage fit well with the simulation results, those for environmental adaptation are consistently too narrow; reasons for the discrepancy are discussed. There is a smooth transition between a system in which a set of loci effectively act independently of each other and one in which they act as a single nonrecombining unit.",

      "abstractNote": "Bioclimate envelope models (BEMs) have often been criticized as being too simplistic due to e.g. not incorporating effects of biotic interactions or evolutionary adaptation. However, BEMs are widely applied and have proven to be often useful. Here we investigate, under which conditions evolution of dispersal, local adaptation or interspecific competition may be of minor importance for forecasting future range shifts. Therefore we use individual-based simulations of metapopulations under climate change living in spatial temperature gradients. Scenarios incorporate single-species systems or systems with competing species, respectively. Dispersal rate is evolving and adaptation to local conditions may also evolve in some scenarios. Results show that in single-species scenarios excluding evolutionary adaptation, species either follow optimal habitat conditions or go extinct if habitat connectivity is too low. These simulations are in close accordance to predictions from BEMs. Including evolutionary adaptation qualitatively changes these results. In the absence of competing species the species either completely invades the world or goes extinct. With competitors, results strongly depend on habitat fragmentation. For highly connected habitats the range border may shift as predicted by BEMs, for intermediate connectivity it will lag behind, while species will go extinct if fragmentation is too high. Our results indicate that (simple) BEMs may work well if habitats are well connected and species will not encounter many difficulties in dispersing to new sites. Selection in this case may promote evolution of even higher dispersal activities. We thus show that the presence of biotic interactions may be ignored for predictions of range shifts when high dispersal can be expected.",

      "abstractNote": "To design population topologies that can accelerate rates of solution discovery in directed evolution problems or for evolutionary optimization applications, we must first systematically understand how population structure shapes evolutionary outcome. Using the mathematical formalism of evolutionary graph theory, recent studies have shown how to topologically build networks of population interaction that increase probabilities of fixation of beneficial mutations, at the expense, however, of longer fixation times, which can slow down rates of evolution, under elevated mutation rate. Here we find that moving beyond dyadic interactions in population graphs is fundamental to explain the trade-offs between probabilities and times to fixation of new mutants in the population. We show that higher-order motifs, and in particular three-node structures, allow the tuning of times to fixation, without changes in probabilities of fixation. This gives a near-continuous control over achieving solutions that allow for a wide range of times to fixation. We apply our algorithms and analytic results to two evolutionary optimization problems and show that the rate of solution discovery can be tuned near continuously by adjusting the higher-order topology of the population. We show that the effects of population structure on the rate of evolution critically depend on the optimization landscape and find that decelerators, with longer times to fixation of new mutants, are able to reach the optimal solutions faster than accelerators in complex solution spaces. Our results highlight that no one population topology fits all optimization applications, and we provide analytic and computational tools that allow for the design of networks suitable for each specific task.",

      "abstractNote": "Polymorphism in loci affecting host resistance and parasite virulence is characteristic for nearly all species and this genetic variation is considered to have profound consequences for the patterns of disease incidence, prevalence and evolution. The gene-for-gene (GFG) system is a well-characterized genetic interaction of host recognition and parasite antigenic loci for a wide range of plant-parasite interactions. Long-term maintenance of polymorphism in GFG systems has remained puzzling for both theoreticians and empiricists. Traditionally this diversity has been explained by tradeoffs with other life-history traits closely linked with fitness, yet empirical evidence for such costs has remained mixed. Here we argue that incorporating simple ecological reality - spatial structuring and gradient of environmental conditions - into host-parasite research will help us understand how polymorphism is maintained. While environmental conditions (biotic and abiotic factors) have been studied in depth in plant pathology for their influence on disease severity and plant yield, they have been rarely set into an evolutionary framework. We briefly review recent data on natural plant-parasite metapopulations and theoretical models moving from single population models towards metapopulation theory to reveal in just how many ways spatial structuring may affect the revolutionary process. We clarify also how spatially heterogeneous selection, through G x E (or G x G x E) interactions, may be particularly important for natural host-parasite interactions and suggest that this provides the unifying ground upon which future theoretical and empirical work should be build on.",

      "abstractNote": "Parasites may be expected to become locally adapted to their hosts. However, while many empirical studies have demonstrated local parasite adaptation, others have failed to demonstrate it, or have shown local parasite maladaptation. Researchers have suggested that gene flow can swamp local parasite-host dynamics and produce local adaptation only at certain geographical scales; others have argued that evolutionary lags can account for both null and maladaptive results. In this paper, we use item response theory (IRT) to test whether host range influences the likelihood of parasites locally adapting to their hosts. We collated 32 independent experiments testing for local adaptation, where parasites could be assigned as having either broad or narrow host ranges (BHR and NHR, respectively). Twenty-five tests based on BHR parasites had a significantly lower average effect size than seven NHR tests, indicating that studies based on BHR parasites are less likely to demonstrate local parasite adaptation. We argue that this may relate to evolutionary lags during diffuse coevolution of BHR parasites with their hosts, rather than differences in experimental approaches or other confounds between BHR and NHR studies.",

      "abstractNote": "Dispersal is a life-history trait that can evolve under various known selective pressures as identified by a multitude of theoretical and empirical studies. Yet only few of them are considering the succession of mating and dispersal. The sequence of these events influences gene flow and consequently affects the dynamics and evolution of populations. We use individual-based simulations to investigate the evolution of the timing of dispersal and mating, i.e. mating before or after dispersal. We assume a discrete insect metapopulation in a heterogeneous environment, where populations may adapt to local conditions and only females are allowed to disperse. We run the model assuming different levels of species habitat tolerance, carrying capacity, and temporal environmental variability. Our results show that in species with narrow habitat tolerance, low to moderate dispersal evolves in combination with mating after dispersal (post-dispersal mating). With such a strategy dispersing females benefit from mating with a resident male, as their offspring will be better adapted to the local habitat conditions. On the contrary, in species with wide habitat tolerance higher dispersal rates in combination with pre-dispersal mating evolves. In this case individuals are adapted to the \u2018average\u2019 habitat where pre-dispersal mating conveys the benefit of carrying relatives\u2019 genes into a new population. With high dispersal rates and large population size, local adaptation and kin structure both vanish and the temporal sequence of dispersal and mating may become a (nearly) neutral trait.",

      "abstractNote": "A method for analyzing long-term demographic data on density-dependent stage-structured populations in a stochastic environment is derived to facilitate comparison of populations and species with different life histories. We assume that a weighted sum of stage abundances, N, exerts density dependence on stage-specific vital rates of survival and reproduction and that N has a small or moderate coefficient of variation. The dynamics of N are approximated as a univariate stochastic process governed by three key parameters: the density-independent growth rate, the net density dependence, and environmental variance in the life history. We show how to estimate the relative weighs of stages in N and the key parameters. Life history evolution represents a stochastic maximization of a simple function of the key parameters. The long-term selection gradient on the life history can be expressed as a vector of sensitivities of this function with respect to density-independent, density-dependent, and stochastic components of the vital rates. To illustrate the method, we analyze 38 years of demographic data on a great tit population, estimating the key parameters, which accurately predict the observed mean, coefficient of variation, and fluctuation rate of N; we also evaluate the long-term selection gradient on the life history.",

      "abstractNote": "The evolution of population dynamics in a stochastic environment is analysed under a general form of density-dependence with genetic variation in r and K, the intrinsic rate of increase and carrying capacity in the average environment, and in \u03c3e2, the environmental variance of population growth rate. The continuous-time model assumes a large population size and a stationary distribution of environments with no autocorrelation. For a given population density, N, and genotype frequency, p, the expected selection gradient is always towards an increased population growth rate, and the expected fitness of a genotype is its Malthusian fitness in the average environment minus the covariance of its growth rate with that of the population. Long-term evolution maximizes the expected value of the density-dependence function, averaged over the stationary distribution of N. In the \u03b8-logistic model, where density dependence of population growth is a function of N\u03b8, long-term evolution maximizes E[N\u03b8]=[1\u2212\u03c3e2/(2r)]K\u03b8. While \u03c3e2 is always selected to decrease, r and K are always selected to increase, implying a genetic trade-off among them. By contrast, given the other parameters, \u03b8 has an intermediate optimum between 1.781 and 2 corresponding to the limits of high or low stochasticity.",

      "abstractNote": "Incipient speciation in a population occupying a continuous range is modeled as the joint evolution of geographic variation in female mating preferences and a quantitative secondary sexual character of males. Genetic variance in both traits is assumed to be maintained within local populations by polygenic mutation and recombination. Three types of polygamous mating systems are analyzed. The models show that sexual isolation and character divergence can originate rapidly over a wide geographic range, driven by genetic instability of the mating system in local populations. During this process, clines forming around a sharp ecological boundary are always monotonic. Even in the absence of genetic instability, the evolution of female mating preferences can greatly amplify large-scale geographic variation in male secondary sexual characters and produce widespread sexual isolation with no geographic discontinuity. These conclusions contrast with the popular conception that premating isolation is selected initially only in the contact zone between races to avoid deleterious hybridization, later spreading slowly if at all to other regions.",

      "abstractNote": "Models of sex chromosome and autosome evolution yield key predictions about the genomic basis of adaptive divergence, and such models have been important in guiding empirical research in comparative genomics and studies of speciation. In addition to the adaptive differentiation that occurs between species over time, selection also favors genetic divergence across geographic space, with subpopulations of single species evolving conspicuous differences in traits involved in adaptation to local environmental conditions. The potential contribution of sex chromosomes (the X or Z) to local adaptation remains unclear, as we currently lack theory that directly links spatial variation in selection to local adaptation of X-linked and autosomal genes. Here, we develop population genetic models that explicitly consider the effects of genetic dominance, effective population size, and sex-specific migration and selection on the relative contributions of X-linked and autosomal genes to local adaptation. We show that X-linked genes should nearly always disproportionately contribute to local adaptation in the presence of gene flow. We also show that considerations of dominance and effective population size-which play pivotal roles in the theory of faster-X adaptation between species-have surprisingly little influence on the relative contribution of the X chromosome to local adaptation. Instead, sex-biased migration is the primary mediator of the strength of spatial large-X effects. Our results yield novel predictions about the role of sex chromosomes in local adaptation. We outline empirical approaches in evolutionary quantitative genetics and genomics that could build upon this new theory.",

      "title": "The genetic differentiation at quantitative trait loci under local adaptation",
      "abstractNote": "Most adaptive traits are controlled by large number of genes that may all together be the targets of selection. Adaptation may thus involve multiple but not necessarily substantial allele frequency changes. This has important consequences for the detection of selected loci and implies that a quantitative genetics framework may be more appropriate than the classical 'selective sweep' paradigm. Preferred methods to detect loci involved in local adaptation are based on the detection of 'outlier' values of the allelic differentiation F(ST) . A quantitative genetics framework is adopted here to review theoretical expectations for how allelic differentiation at quantitative trait loci (F(STQ) ) relates to (i), neutral genetic differentiation (F(ST) ) and (ii), phenotypic differentiation (Q(ST) ). We identify cases where results of outlier-based methods are likely to be poor and where differentiation at selected loci conveys little information regarding local adaptation. A first case is when neutral differentiation is high, so that local adaptation does not necessitate increased differentiation. A second case is when local adaptation is reached via an increased covariance of allelic effects rather than via allele frequency changes, which is more likely under high gene flow when the number of loci is high and selection is recent. The comparison of theoretical predictions with observed data from the literature suggests that polygenic local adaptation involving only faint allele frequency changes are very likely in some species such as forest trees and for climate-related traits. Recent methodological improvements that may alleviate the weakness of F(ST) -based detection methods are presented.",

      "abstractNote": "Global change has made it important to understand the factors that shape species\u2019 distributions. Central to this area of research is the question of whether species\u2019 range limits primarily re\ufb02ect the distribution of suitable habitat (i.e. niche limits) or arise as a result of dispersal limitation. Over-the-edge transplant experiments and ecological niche models are commonly used to address this question, yet few studies have taken advantage of a combined approach for inferring the causes of range limits. Here, we synthesise results from existing transplant experiments with new information on the predicted suitability of sites based on niche models. We found that individual performance and habitat suitability independently decline beyond range limits across multiple species. Furthermore, inferences from transplant experiments and niche models were generally concordant within species, with 31 out of 40 cases fully supporting the hypothesis that range limits are niche limits. These results suggest that range limits are often niche limits and that the factors constraining species\u2019 ranges operate at scales detectable by both transplant experiments and niche models. In light of these \ufb01ndings, we outline an integrative framework for addressing the causes of range limits in individual species.",

      "title": "Ecological Genetic Conflict: Genetic Architecture Can Shift the Balance between Local Adaptation and Plasticity",
      "abstractNote": "Genetic polymorphism can contribute to local adaptation in heterogeneous habitats, for instance, as a single locus with alleles adapted to different habitats. Phenotypic plasticity can also contribute to trait variation across habitats, through developmental responses to habitat-specific cues. We show that the genetic architecture of genetically polymorphic and plasticity loci may influence the balance between local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. These effects of genetic architecture are instances of ecological genetic conflict. A reduced effective migration rate for genes tightly linked to a genetic polymorphism provides an explanation for the effects, and they can occur both for a single trait and for a syndrome of coadapted traits. Using individual-based simulations and numerical analysis, we investigate how among-habitat genetic polymorphism and phenotypic plasticity depend on genetic architecture. We also study the evolution of genetic architecture itself, in the form of rates of recombination between genetically polymorphic loci and plasticity loci. Our main result is that for plasticity genes that are unlinked to loci with between-habitat genetic polymorphism, the slope of a reaction norm is steeper in comparison with the slope favored by plasticity genes that are tightly linked to genes for local adaptation.",

      "title": "Evolution of Phenotypic Clusters Through Competition and Local Adaptation Along an Environmental Gradient",
      "abstractNote": "We have analyzed the evolution of a quantitative trait in populations that are spatially extended along an environmental gradient, with gene flow between nearby locations. In the absence of competition, there is stabilizing selection toward a locally best-adapted trait that changes gradually along the gradient. According to traditional ideas, gradual spatial variation in environmental conditions is expected to lead to gradual variation in the evolved trait. A contrasting possibility is that the trait distribution instead breaks up into discrete clusters. Doebeli and Dieckmann (2003) argued that competition acting locally in trait space and geographical space can promote such clustering. We have investigated this possibility using deterministic population dynamics for asexual populations, analyzing our model numerically and through an analytical approximation. We examined how the evolution of clusters is affected by the shape of competition kernels, by the presence of Allee effects, and by the strength of gene flow along the gradient. For certain parameter ranges clustering was a robust outcome, and for other ranges there was no clustering. Our analysis shows that the shape of competition kernels is important for clustering: the sign structure of the Fourier transform of a competition kernel determines whether the kernel promotes clustering. Also, we found that Allee effects promote clustering, whereas gene flow can have a counteracting influence. In line with earlier findings, we could demonstrate that phenotypic clustering was favored by gradients of intermediate slope.",

      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation is of fundamental importance in evolutionary, population, conservation, and global-change biology. The generality of local adaptation in plants and whether and how it is influenced by specific species, population and habitat characteristics have, however, not been quantitatively reviewed. Therefore, we examined published data on the outcomes of reciprocal transplant experiments using two approaches. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the performance of local and foreign plants at all transplant sites. In addition, we analysed frequencies of pairs of plant origin to examine whether local plants perform better than foreign plants at both compared transplant sites. In both approaches, we also examined the effects of population size, and of the habitat and species characteristics that are predicted to affect local adaptation. We show that, overall, local plants performed significantly better than foreign plants at their site of origin: this was found to be the case in 71.0% of the studied sites. However, local plants performed better than foreign plants at both sites of a pair-wise comparison (strict definition of local adaption) only in 45.3% of the 1032 compared population pairs. Furthermore, we found local adaptation much more common for large plant populations (>1000 flowering individuals) than for small populations (<1000 flowering individuals) for which local adaptation was very rare. The degree of local adaptation was independent of plant life history, spatial or temporal habitat heterogeneity, and geographic scale. Our results suggest that local adaptation is less common in plant populations than generally assumed. Moreover, our findings reinforce the fundamental importance of population size for evolutionary theory. The clear role of population size for the ability to evolve local adaptation raises considerable doubt on the ability of small plant populations to cope with changing environments.",

      "abstractNote": "We report a likelihood\u2010based method that estimates both dispersal and natural selection using the rate of change of the shape of a cline when selection and migration are not constant through time. We have investigated the case of local adaptation of the mosquito Culex pipiens to organophosphate insecticides in the Montpellier area in France. We have analyzed the modification of the clinal patterns at two resistance loci during the period from breeding to overwintering. We show that mosquitoes migrate extensively from breeding to overwintering sites at a rate that is markedly different from previous estimates made during the breeding season only. This migration is also strongly asymmetrical, which can be explained by different geographical distributions of breeding and overwintering sites, by variation in mosquito density along the transect, or by behavioral biases. We found that the starting time of overwintering is likely to vary between northern and southern populations and that substantial fitness costs are associated with resistance alleles at the two loci during overwintering. These results illustrate how demography and adaptive microevolution can be studied using selected markers. The method provides a framework to use population genetics and statistical models to reveal ecological and evolutionary processes.",

      "abstractNote": "Most models describing the evolution of recombination have focused on the case of a single population, implicitly assuming that all individuals are equally likely to mate and that spatial heterogeneity in selection is absent. In these models, the evolution of recombination is driven by linkage disequilibria generated either by epistatic selection or drift. Models based on epistatic selection show that recombination can be favored if epistasis is negative and weak compared to directional selection and if the recombination modifier locus is tightly linked to the selected loci. In this article, we examine the joint effects of spatial heterogeneity in selection and epistasis on the evolution of recombination. In a model with two patches, each subject to different selection regimes, we consider the cases of mutation-selection and migration-selection balance as well as the spread of beneficial alleles. We find that including spatial heterogeneity extends the range of epistasis over which recombination can be favored. Indeed, recombination can be favored without epistasis, with negative and even with positive epistasis depending on environmental circumstances. The selection pressure acting on recombination-modifier loci is often much stronger with spatial heterogeneity, and even loosely linked modifiers and free linkage may evolve. In each case, predicting whether recombination is favored requires knowledge of both the type of environmental heterogeneity and epistasis, as none of these factors alone is sufficient to predict the outcome.",

      "abstractNote": "In general, individuals who survive to reproduce have genotypes that work relatively well under local conditions. Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns, species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic processes.",

      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation is the first step in the process of ecological speciation. It is, however, an unstable and dynamic situation. It can be strengthened by the occurrence of alleles more specialized to the different habitats or vanish if generalist alleles arise by mutations and increase in frequency. This process can have complicated dynamics as specialist alleles may be much more common and may maintain local adaptation for a long time. Thus, even in the absence of an absolute fitness tradeoff between habitats, local adaptation may persist a long time before vanishing. Furthermore, several feedback loops can help to maintain it (the reinforcement, demographic, and recombination loops). This reinforcement can occur by modifying one of the three fundamental steps in a sexual life cycle (dispersal, syngamy, meiosis), which promotes genetic clustering by causing specific genetic associations. Distinguishing these mechanisms complements the one- versus two-allele classification. Overall, the relative rates of the two processes (specialization and reinforcement) dictate whether ecological speciation will occur.",

      "abstractNote": "The different strategies of insecticide resistance management that have been formulated so far consist of delaying the appearance and spread of resistance genes. In this paper, we propose a strategy that can be used even if resistance genes are already present. This strategy consists of applying insecticides in an area smaller than a certain critical size, so that gene flow from the untreated area, combined with the fitness cost of the resistance genes, prevents its frequency reaching high equilibrium value. A two-locus model was analysed numerically to determine population densities at equilibrium as a function of selection coefficients (insecticide selection, fitness costs of resistance genes and dominances), gene flow and size of the treated area. This model indicates that there is an optimal size for the treated area where a minimal and stable density reach equilibrium, and where resistance genes cannot invade. This resistance management strategy seems applicable to a large variety of field situations, but eventually it may encounter obstacles due to a modifier which reduces the fitness costs of resistance genes.",

The characteristics of the optimal population can be found for each environmental pattern, and conditions determined in which the optimum is specialized or generalized, mono- or polymorphic, differentiated into discrete races or gradually along clines. These results are shown in table 1. The next paper in this series will extend the model and discuss experimental approaches for testing the theory.",

      "abstractNote": "Spatial structure has dramatic effects on the demography and the evolution of species. A large variety of theoretical models have attempted to understand how local dispersal may shape the coevolution of interacting species such as host\u2013parasite interactions. The lack of a unifying framework is a serious impediment for anyone willing to understand current theory. Here, we review previous theoretical studies in the light of a single epidemiological model that allows us to explore the effects of both host and parasite migration rates on the evolution and coevolution of various life-history traits. We discuss the impact of local dispersal on parasite virulence, various host defence strategies and local adaptation. Our analysis shows that evolutionary and coevolutionary outcomes crucially depend on the details of the host\u2013parasite life cycle and on which life-history trait is involved in the interaction. We also discuss experimental studies that support the effects of spatial structure on the evolution of host\u2013parasite interactions. This review highlights major similarities between some theoretical results, but it also reveals an important gap between evolutionary and coevolutionary models. We discuss possible ways to bridge this gap within a more unified framework that would reconcile spatial epidemiology, evolution and coevolution.",

      "abstractNote": "Our understanding of the evolution of quantitative traits in nature is still limited by the challenge of including realistic trait distributions in the context of frequency-dependent selection and ecological feedbacks. We extend to class-structured populations a recently introduced \u201coligomorphic approximation,\u201d which bridges the gap between adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics approaches and allows for the joint description of the dynamics of ecological variables and of the moments of multimodal trait distributions. Our theoretical framework allows us to analyze the dynamics of populations composed of several morphs and structured into distinct classes (e.g., age, size, habitats, infection status, and species). We also introduce a new approximation to simplify the eco-evolutionary dynamics using reproductive values. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to the important conceptual case of two-habitat migration-selection models. In particular, we show that our approach allows us to predict both the long-term evolutionary end points and the short-term transient dynamics of the eco-evolutionary process, including fast evolution regimes. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our results and sketch perspectives for future work.",

      "abstractNote": "Landscape genomics is a relatively new discipline that aims to reveal the relationship between adaptive genetic imprints in genomes and environmental heterogeneity among natural populations. Although the interest in landscape genomics has increased since this term was coined, studies on this topic remain scarce. Landscape genomics has become a powerful method to scan and determine the genes responsible for the complex adaptive evolution of species at population (mostly) and individual (more rarely) level. This review outlines the sampling strategies, molecular marker types and research categories in 37 articles published during the first 10 years of this field (i.e., 2007\u20132016). We also address major challenges and future directions for landscape genomics. This review aims to promote interest in conducting additional studies in landscape genomics.",

      "abstractNote": "Bet-hedging\u2014a strategy that reduces fitness variance at the expense of lower mean fitness among different generations\u2014is thought to evolve as a biological adaptation to environmental unpredictability. Despite widespread use of the bet-hedging concept, most theoretical treatments have largely made unrealistic demographic assumptions, such as non-overlapping generations and fixed or infinite population sizes. Here, we extend the concept to consider overlapping generations by defining bet-hedging as a strategy with lower variance and mean per capita growth rate across different environments. We also define an opposing strategy\u2014the rising-tide\u2014that has higher mean but also higher variance in per capita growth. These alternative strategies lie along a continuum of biological adaptions to environmental fluctuation. Using stochastic Lotka\u2013Volterra models to explore the evolution of the rising-tide versus bet-hedging strategies, we show that both the mean environmental conditions and the temporal scales of their fluctuations, as well as whether population dynamics are discrete or continuous, are crucial in shaping the type of strategy that evolves in fluctuating environments. Our model demonstrates that there are likely to be a wide range of ways that organisms with overlapping generations respond to environmental unpredictability beyond the classic bet-hedging concept.",

      "abstractNote": "Using a reciprocal cross-infection experiment, we detected clinal variation in the relative ability of trematodes to infect snails taken from the same habitat. Snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) collected from three habitats in a New Zealand lake were exposed to a digenetic trematode (Microphailus sp.) collected from infected snails from the same three locations. The habitats were arranged according to depth, from shallow (the shore bank habitat: less than 1 m deep), to intermediate (the Is\u00f2\u00ebtes habitat: 1.5-3 m), to deep (the Elodea habitat: 4-6 m). Snails were assayed for infection at two points in the development of the parasite: 4-months post infection (the blastocercariae stage), in which the parasite was not yet infective to the final hosts (ducks), and 7-months post infection (the metacercariae stage), in which the worms were fully encysted and competent for transmission to the final host. At 7-months post infection, the results showed that shallow-water parasites were significantly more infective to shallow-water hosts, but deep-water parasites were about equally infective to snails from all three habitats. This result suggests that gene flow by the parasite is primarily from shallow to deep habitats, and that recycling of the parasite and host-parasite coevolution is primarily in shallow water. Such recycling would be consistent with our observations of foraging by the definitive host of the parasite, and may explain the maintenance of high frequencies of sexual individuals around the shallow-water margins of the lake.",

      "abstractNote": "How does evolution in parasite populations affect the rate of disease spread? In the present study, I derived the mean reproductive rate (\n\ud835\udc45\n\u23af\n\u23af\n\u23af\n0\nR\u00af0\n) for a genetically diverse parasite population that is evolving with a similarly diverse host population. Assuming a matching-alleles model, I found that \n\ud835\udc45\n\u23af\n\u23af\n\u23af\n0\nR\u00af0\n is a positive function of the covariance between the frequencies of \u201cmatching\u201d host and parasite genotypes. Computer simulations further showed that evolution in the parasite population tends to increase the covariance, which can lead to epidemiological feedbacks. However, the covariances can also become negative during counteradaptation by the host, leading to oscillatory dynamics in host and parasite fitness. Nonetheless, when parasite-mediated selection is strong, the covariance is positive on average, which facilitates the spread of disease. Positive covariances may also underlie patterns of local adaptation in parasite populations and increase the selective advantage of cross-fertilization in host populations.",

      "abstractNote": "The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is predicated on structured populations of interacting species where gene flow and the force of selection can vary among populations, leading to a mosaic of traits in space. Here, I briefly review some recent studies of adaptation by a sterilizing parasite to structured populations of a freshwater snail. The results show geographic structure as expected under the geographic mosaic model. I then consider the effects of virulence and migration on local adaptation by parasites using a computer simulation. The results suggest that high virulence and low migration contribute to the strength of local adaptation by parasites. Highly virulent parasites showed adaptation to local hosts for migration rates of up to 10% of the population per generation. In addition, because of the dynamic nature of host-parasite coevolution, the magnitude of local adaptation fluctuates over time. During some points in the cycle, parasites may be no more effective at infecting individuals from local host populations, even though they would be shown to be locally adapted if examined over enough generations. Contrary to expectation, parasite local adaptation was not affected by giving the parasite a longer generation time than the host, but differences in local selection intensities had a dramatic effect.",

      "abstractNote": "Evolution of local adaptation depends critically on the level of gene flow, which, in plants, can be due to either pollen or seed dispersal. Using analytical predictions and individual-centred simulations, we investigate the specific influence of seed and pollen dispersal on local adaptation in plant populations growing in patchy heterogeneous landscapes. We study the evolution of a polygenic trait subject to stabilizing selection within populations, but divergent selection between populations. Deviations from linkage equilibrium and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium make different contributions to genotypic variance depending on the dispersal mode. Local genotypic variance, differentiation between populations and genetic load vary with the rate of gene flow but are similar for seed and pollen dispersal, unless the landscape is very heterogeneous. In this case, genetic load is higher in the case of pollen dispersal, which appears to be due to differences in the distribution of genotypic values before selection.",

      "abstractNote": "Contrasts of differences within plant species and ecotypes are often best examined in ecology, evolution and genetics through provenance and biogeographical comparisons. Climate adaptation studies in plants are no exception and benefit from experiments that use these sets of factors. Reciprocal common gardens are a tool used to test for local adaptation in species to different contexts including climate. A synthesis of common gardens and intraspecific tests for climate adaptation was used to compile over 200 studies that explored the relative efficacy of this tool and the ecology of change. Exclusion criteria were applied to review this literature and to compile specific tests that explicitly examined climate, plants and reciprocity in gardens for a total of 70 independent instances. A meta-analysis was used to test for consistency and significance of detecting ecotypes for the different categories of traits tested and by the transplanting of seeds or seedlings. This meta-analysis provides clear evidence for plant adaptation to climate change because all significant effect size estimates were positive, relatively large, and both seed and seedling transplants demonstrated consistent evidence for local adaptation. Emergence and germination responses from seed transplant experiments and relative growth and biomass differences from seedling transplants provided particularly strong support. Synthesis. Reciprocal common gardens were a highly effective experimental design to test for ecotypic differentiation and for climate adaptation. Nonetheless, we propose that future studies clearly define whether ecotypes are being explicitly tested in common garden experiments to enable evidence syntheses and discovery, and we highlight the need for reciprocal climatic gardens to clearly test for continued capacity for local adaptation in response to divergent climate selection processes in many plant species.",

      "abstractNote": "FST outlier tests are a potentially powerful way to detect genetic loci under spatially divergent selection. Unfortunately, the extent to which these tests are robust to nonequilibrium demographic histories has been understudied. We developed a landscape genetics simulator to test the effects of isolation by distance (IBD) and range expansion on FST outlier methods. We evaluated the two most commonly used methods for the identification of FST outliers (FDIST2 and BayeScan, which assume samples are evolutionarily independent) and two recent methods (FLK and Bayenv2, which estimate and account for evolutionary nonindependence). Parameterization with a set of neutral loci (\u2018neutral parameterization\u2019) always improved the performance of FLK and Bayenv2, while neutral parameterization caused FDIST2 to actually perform worse in the cases of IBD or range expansion. BayeScan was improved when the prior odds on neutrality was increased, regardless of the true odds in the data. On their best performance, however, the widely used methods had high false-positive rates for IBD and range expansion and were outperformed by methods that accounted for evolutionary nonindependence. In addition, default settings in FDIST2 and BayeScan resulted in many false positives suggesting balancing selection. However, all methods did very well if a large set of neutral loci is available to create empirical P-values. We conclude that in species that exhibit IBD or have undergone range expansion, many of the published FST outliers based on FDIST2 and BayeScan are probably false positives, but FLK and Bayenv2 show great promise for accurately identifying loci under spatially divergent selection.",

      "title": "The paradox of adaptive trait clines with nonclinal patterns in the underlying genes",
      "abstractNote": "Multivariate climate change presents an urgent need to understand how species adapt to complex environments. Population genetic theory predicts that loci under selection will form monotonic allele frequency clines with their selective environment, which has led to the wide use of genotype\u2013environment associations (GEAs). This study used a set of simulations to elucidate the conditions under which allele frequency clines are more or less likely to evolve as multiple quantitative traits adapt to multivariate environments. Phenotypic clines evolved with nonmonotonic (i.e., nonclinal) patterns in allele frequencies under conditions that promoted unique combinations of mutations to achieve the multivariate optimum in different parts of the landscape. Such conditions resulted from interactions among landscape, demography, pleiotropy, and genetic architecture. GEA methods failed to accurately infer the genetic basis of adaptation under a range of scenarios due to first principles (clinal patterns did not evolve) or statistical issues (clinal patterns evolved but were not detected due to overcorrection for structure). Despite the limitations of GEAs, this study shows that a back-transformation of multivariate ordination can accurately predict individual multivariate traits from genotype and environmental data regardless of whether inference from GEAs was accurate. In addition, frameworks are introduced that can be used by empiricists to quantify the importance of clinal alleles in adaptation. This research highlights that multivariate trait prediction from genotype and environmental data can lead to accurate inference regardless of whether the underlying loci display clinal or nonmonotonic patterns.",

      "abstractNote": "Although genome scans have become a popular approach towards understanding the genetic basis of local adaptation, the field still does not have a firm grasp on how sampling design and demographic history affect the performance of genome scans on complex landscapes. To explore these issues, we compared 20 different sampling designs in equilibrium (i.e. island model and isolation by distance) and nonequilibrium (i.e. range expansion from one or two refugia) demographic histories in spatially heterogeneous environments. We simulated spatially complex landscapes, which allowed us to exploit local maxima and minima in the environment in 'pair' and 'transect' sampling strategies. We compared F(ST) outlier and genetic-environment association (GEA) methods for each of two approaches that control for population structure: with a covariance matrix or with latent factors. We show that while the relative power of two methods in the same category (F(ST) or GEA) depended largely on the number of individuals sampled, overall GEA tests had higher power in the island model and F(ST) had higher power under isolation by distance. In the refugia models, however, these methods varied in their power to detect local adaptation at weakly selected loci. At weakly selected loci, paired sampling designs had equal or higher power than transect or random designs to detect local adaptation. Our results can inform sampling designs for studies of local adaptation and have important implications for the interpretation of genome scans based on landscape data.",

      "abstractNote": "All species are locked in a continual struggle to adapt to local ecological conditions. In cases where species fail to locally adapt, they face reduced population growth rates, or even local extinction. Traditional explanations for limited local adaptation focus on maladaptive gene flow or homogeneous environmental conditions. These classical explanations have, however, failed to explain variation in the magnitude of local adaptation observed across taxa. Here we show that variable levels of local adaptation are better explained by trait dimensionality. First, we develop and analyse mathematical models that predict levels of local adaptation will increase with the number of traits experiencing spatially variable selection. Next, we test this prediction by estimating the relationship between dimensionality and local adaptation using data from 35 published reciprocal transplant studies. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between dimensionality and degree of local adaptation, and thus provides empirical support for the predictions of our model.",

      "abstractNote": "1. Parasite virulence varies greatly. Theory predicts that this arises from parasites optimising a trade-off between the mortality they inflict on current hosts, and their transmission to future hosts. The effect of the environment on this co-evolution is rarely considered. 2. Geographic mosaics are fertile systems for studying co-evolution, but again, the diversity of outcomes is often assumed to result from co-evolutionary dynamism, rather than being moulded by the environment. 3. Here, we quantify variation in virulence among lakes in a geographic mosaic of co-evolution between a trematode ectoparasite (Gyrodactylus arcuatus) and its three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) host. 4. Virulence varies greatly in this system, and parasites are generally locally adapted to their hosts. 5. Parasites are also locally adapted to the water in their own lake, and virulence is strongly related to lake pH, the dominant axis of abiotic environmental variation in this system. 6. These results suggest that the evolution of virulence can be substantially affected by the abiotic environment, which has important implications for understanding co-evolution. There are also implications for the evolutionary management of disease, e.g. ectoparasites in aquaculture, the impacts of which might be expected to reduce given ongoing acidification of aquatic ecosystems.",

      "abstractNote": "Neutrality tests in quantitative genetics provide a statistical framework for the detection of selection on polygenic traits in wild populations. However, the existing method based on comparisons of divergence at neutral markers and quantitative traits (Qst\u2013Fst) suffers from several limitations that hinder a clear interpretation of the results with typical empirical designs. In this article, we propose a multivariate extension of this neutrality test based on empirical estimates of the among-populations (D) and within-populations (G) covariance matrices by MANOVA. A simple pattern is expected under neutrality: D = 2Fst/(1 \u2212 Fst)G, so that neutrality implies both proportionality of the two matrices and a specific value of the proportionality coefficient. This pattern is tested using Flury's framework for matrix comparison [common principal-component (CPC) analysis], a well-known tool in G matrix evolution studies. We show the importance of using a Bartlett adjustment of the test for the small sample sizes typically found in empirical studies. We propose a dual test: (i) that the proportionality coefficient is not different from its neutral expectation [2Fst/(1 \u2212 Fst)] and (ii) that the MANOVA estimates of mean square matrices between and among populations are proportional. These two tests combined provide a more stringent test for neutrality than the classic Qst\u2013Fst comparison and avoid several statistical problems. Extensive simulations of realistic empirical designs suggest that these tests correctly detect the expected pattern under neutrality and have enough power to efficiently detect mild to strong selection (homogeneous, heterogeneous, or mixed) when it is occurring on a set of traits. This method also provides a rigorous and quantitative framework for disentangling the effects of different selection regimes and of drift on the evolution of the G matrix. We discuss practical requirements for the proper application of our test in empirical studies and potential extensions.",

      "abstractNote": "Self-fertilization is classically thought to be associated with propagule dispersal because self-fertilization is a boon to colonizers entering environments devoid of pollinators or potential mates. Yet, it has been theoretically shown that random fluctuations in pollination conditions select for the opposite association of traits. In nature, however, various ecological factors may deviate from random variations, and thus create temporal correlation in pollination conditions. Here, we develop a model to assess the effects of pollination condition autocorrelation on the joint evolution of dispersal and self-fertilization. Basically, two syndromes are found: dispersing outcrossers and nondispersing (partial) selfers. Importantly, (1) selfers are never associated with dispersal, whereas complete outcrossers are, and (2) the disperser/outcrosser syndrome is favoured (resp. disfavoured) by negative (resp. positive) autocorrelation in pollination conditions. Our results suggest that observed dispersal/mating system syndromes may depend heavily on the regime of pollination condition fluctuations. We also point out potential negative evolutionary effects of anthropic management of the environment on outcrossing species",

      "abstractNote": "We analyze the long-term evolution of a continuous trait subject to frequency-dependent disruptive selection, and controlled by a single diploid, additive locus. Our simple selection model is a mathematical approximation to many complex systems of ecological interactions resulting in disruptive selection, like, for example, scramble competition and habitat heterogeneity. A polymorphism of two specific alleles at equal frequencies is the unique long-term equilibrium, or ESS, of this system. We then study the evolution of direct assortative mating for the se-lected trait, through mutations of small effect at modifier loci controlling the degree of assortment. The mating process is described by a model that allows for possible costs of assortment. Unless the cost of assortment is too high, strength of assortment always increases in populations where mating is random or weakly assortative, and also in populations that already practice very strong assortative mating. However, even if it has no cost, assort-ment can increase continuously from random mating to complete isolation, resulting in sympatric speciation, only if selection is sufficiently strong. In fact, only a modest degree of assortment, corresponding to a continuously stable ESS, can be attained from random mating, when selection intensity is below a certain threshold.",

Although asynchronous temporal fluctuations select for dispersal, spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of fluctuating environmental variables selects against it. We find evolutionary branching in dispersal rate leading to the evolutionarily stable coexistence of a high- and a low-dispersal phenotype. We study how the opposing forces of selection for and against dispersal change with the relative size and the environmental qualities of the source and sink habitats. Our results suggest that the evolution of dispersal dimorphism could be a first step towards speciation and local adaptation.",

      "abstractNote": "Background selection is a process whereby recurrent deleterious mutations cause a decrease in the effective population size and genetic diversity at linked loci. Several authors have suggested that variation in the intensity of background selection could cause variation in F-ST across the genome, which could confound signals of local adaptation in genome scans. We performed realistic simulations of DNA sequences, using recombination maps from humans and sticklebacks, to investigate how variation in the intensity of background selection affects F-ST and other statistics of population differentiation in sexual, outcrossing species. We show that, in populations connected by gene flow, Weir and Cockerham's (1984; Evolution, 38, 1358) estimator of F-ST is largely insensitive to locus-to-locus variation in the intensity of background selection. Unlike F-ST, however, d(XY) is negatively correlated with background selection. Moreover, background selection does not greatly affect the false-positive rate in F-ST outlier studies in populations connected by gene flow. Overall, our study indicates that background selection will not greatly interfere with finding the variants responsible for local adaptation.",

      "title": "Gene Frequency Clines in the Presence of Selection Opposed by Gene Flow",
      "abstractNote": "Suppose we have a cline in gene frequency which results from spatially varying selection forces (which tend to establish the cline) opposed by gene flow (which tends to blur the cline). The characteristic width, W, of this gene frequency cline can be assessed qualitatively in terms of the parameters characterizing the selection and gene flow processes. We define \u0394 as the transition distance in the selection gradient, s as the maximum selection intensity (see fig. 1), l as the root-mean-square gene flow distance (see eq. [3]), and lc = l/ $$\\sqrt s$$ (see eq. [5]): then for \u0394 < lc we have W \u223c lc, and consequently W > \u0394 (as discussed fully by Slatkin 1973); conversely for \u0394 > lc we have W \u223c (lc2 \u0394)1/3, and consequently lc < W < \u0394. The former circumstance may be thought of as relatively strong gene flow and a relatively blurred cline (W > \u0394); the latter circumstance as relatively weak gene flow and a relatively sharp cline (W < \u0394). The above qualitative results pertain to all situations where the fitness of the heterozygotes, Aa, is intermediate between (or, in the event of a dominant allele A or a, coincident with one of) the homozygotes AA and aa. In particular, the detailed results of table 1 apply if the heterozygotes are of precisely intermediate fitness and table 2 applies if there is dominance, so that the heterozygote fitness coincides with one of the homozygotes. More generally, if the heterozygotes are at a strong disadvantage, measured by the selection parameter h of equation (15), the gene frequency cline is steepened and has typical width W \u223c l/ $$\\sqrt{-h}$$ . Conversely, strong heterozygous advantage leads to a very smooth cline and eventually to essentially equal frequencies of A and a at all points. The presence of asymmetry in the gene flow, as may easily arise from a prevailing wind or other environmental effect, can substantially modify the slope and position of a gene frequency cline. This can happen even when the characteristic scale length of the asymmetry (see eq. [22]) is relatively small. These results unify a large number of numerical simulations of such situations, some of which have been done for a stepped environmental gradient (effectively \u0394 < lc) and others for a continuous selection gradient (effectively \u0394 > lc). Some studies on real clines produced by the tension between selection and gene flow contain enough data to permit rough comparison with theory. The agreement between nature and qualitative theory is surprisingly good in several cases (see table 3). Field data of this sort are rare, as quantitative information about gene flow and about selective forces is difficult to get. The main aim of this paper is to present an orderly framework within which to assemble such data.",

      "abstractNote": "In evolutionary dynamics, a key measure of a mutant trait\u2019s success is the probability that it takes over the population given some initial mutant-appearance distribution. This \u201cfixation probability\u201d is difficult to compute in general, as it depends on the mutation\u2019s effect on the organism as well as the population\u2019s spatial structure, mating patterns, and other factors. In this study, we consider weak selection, which means that the mutation\u2019s effect on the organism is small. We obtain a weak-selection perturbation expansion of a mutant\u2019s fixation probability, from an arbitrary initial configuration of mutant and resident types. Our results apply to a broad class of stochastic evolutionary models, in which the size and spatial structure are arbitrary (but fixed). The problem of whether selection favors a given trait is thereby reduced from exponential to polynomial complexity in the population size, when selection is weak. We conclude by applying these methods to obtain new results for evolutionary dynamics on graphs.",

      "title": "Effect of migration and environmental heterogeneity on the maintenance of quantitative genetic variation: a simulation study",
      "abstractNote": "The paradox of high genetic variation observed in traits under stabilizing selection is a long-standing problem in evolutionary theory, as mutation rates appear too low to explain observed levels of standing genetic variation under classic models of mutation\u2013selection balance. Spatially or temporally heterogeneous environments can maintain more standing genetic variation within populations than homogeneous environments, but it is unclear whether such conditions can resolve the above discrepancy between theory and observation. Here, we use individual-based simulations to explore the effect of various types of environmental heterogeneity on the maintenance of genetic variation (VA) for a quantitative trait under stabilizing selection. We find that VA is maximized at intermediate migration rates in spatially heterogeneous environments and that the observed patterns are robust to changes in population size. Spatial environmental heterogeneity increased variation by as much as 10-fold over mutation\u2013selection balance alone, whereas pure temporal environmental heterogeneity increased variance by only 45% at max. Our results show that some combinations of spatial heterogeneity and migration can maintain considerably more variation than mutation\u2013selection balance, potentially reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and empirical observations. However, given the narrow regions of parameter space required for this effect, this is unlikely to provide a general explanation for the maintenance of variation. Nonetheless, our results suggest that habitat fragmentation may affect the maintenance of VA and thereby reduce the adaptive capacity of populations.",

However, restoration efforts can result in the introduction of novel genes and genotypes into populations when plant materials used are not of local origin. This movement is potentially important because many plant species are subdivided into populations that are adapted to local environmental conditions. Here we focus on genetic concerns arising from ongoing restoration efforts, where often little is known about \u201cHow local is local?\u201d (i.e., the geographic or environmental scale over which plant species are adapted). We review the major issues regarding gene flow and local adaptation in the restoration of natural plant populations.

      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation frequently evolves in patches or environments that are connected via migration. In these cases, genomic regions that are linked to an adaptive locus experience reduced effective migration rates. Via individual-based simulations of a two-patch system, we show that this reduced effective migration results in the accumulation of conditionally deleterious mutations, but not universally deleterious mutations, adjacent to adaptive loci. When there is redundancy in the genetic basis of local adaptation (i.e. genotypic redundancy), turnover of adaptive loci allows conditionally deleterious mutation load to be purged. The amount of mutational load that accumulates adjacent to adaptive loci is dependent on redundancy, recombination rate, migration rate, population size, strength of selection, and the phenotypic effect size of adaptive alleles. Our results highlight the need to be cautious when interpreting patterns of local adaptation at the level of phenotype or fitness, as the genetic basis of local adaptation can be transient, and evolution may confer a degree of maladaptation to non-local environments.",

      "abstractNote": "Adaptation within species to local environments is widespread in nature. Better understanding this local adaptation is critical to conserving biodiversity. However, conservation practices can rely on species\u2019 trait averages or can broadly assume homogeneity across the range to inform management. Recent methodological advances for studying local adaptation provide the opportunity to fine-tune efforts for managing and conserving species. The implementation of these advances will allow us to better identify populations at greatest risk of decline because of climate change, as well as highlighting possible strategies for improving the likelihood of population persistence amid climate change. In the present article, we review recent advances in the study of local adaptation and highlight ways these tools can be applied in conservation efforts. Cutting-edge tools are available to help better identify and characterize local adaptation. Indeed, increased incorporation of local adaptation in management decisions may help meet the imminent demands of managing species amid a rapidly changing world.",

      "abstractNote": "Microbial populations in nature generally inhabit extended environments with substantial spatial variation in ecological factors: light intensity in the ocean, temperature in geothermal hot springs, or a variety of chemical concentrations including salt and pH. In such continuously varying environments, it remains unclear why a finite number of subpopulations form and how this number is set. Here we show that a model of asexual evolution in a gradient maps onto a no-gradient neutral model, and by mapping this model to a gas of kinks and antikinks, we derive the full distribution of the number of coexisting lineages, and their correlation functions. Testing these predictions in controlled laboratory experiments would provide valuable insights into many real-world microbial communities.",

      "abstractNote": "The spatial genetic composition of hybrid zones exhibits a range of possible patterns, with many characterized by patchy distributions. While several hypothetical explanations exist for the maintenance of these \"mosaic\" hybrid zones, they remain virtually unexplored theoretically. Using computer simulations we investigate the roles of dispersal and assortative mating in the formation and persistence of hybrid zone structure. To quantify mosaic structure we develop a likelihood method, which we apply to simulation and empirical data. We find that long distance dispersal can lead to a patchy distribution that assortative mating can then reinforce, ultimately producing a mosaic capable of persisting over evolutionarily significant periods of time. By reducing the mating success of rare males, assortative mating creates a positive within-patch frequency-dependent selective pressure. Selection against heterozygotes can similarly create a rare-type disadvantage and we show that it can also preserve structure. We find that mosaic structure is maintained across a range of assumptions regarding the form and strength of assortative mating. Interestingly, we find that higher levels of mosaic structure are sometimes observed for intermediate assortment strengths. The high incidence of assortment documented in hybrid zones suggests that it may play a key role in stabilizing their form and structure.",

      "abstractNote": "Adaptation in spatially heterogeneous environments results from the balance between local selection, mutation, and migration. We study the interplay among these different evolutionary forces and demography in a classical two-habitat scenario with asexual reproduction. We develop a new theoretical approach that goes beyond the Adaptive Dynamics framework, and allows us to explore the effect of high mutation rates on the stationary phenotypic distribution. We show that this approach improves the classical Gaussian approximation, and captures accurately the shape of this equilibrium phenotypic distribution in one- and two-population scenarios. We examine the evolutionary equilibrium under general conditions where demography and selection may be nonsymmetric between the two habitats. In particular, we show how migration may increase differentiation in a source\u2013sink scenario. We discuss the implications of these analytic results for the adaptation of organisms with large mutation rates, such as RNA viruses.",

      "abstractNote": "In this study, we examine the ecology and adaptive dynamics of an asexually reproducing population, migrating along an environmental gradient. The living conditions are optimal at the central location and deteriorate outwards. The different strategies are optimized to the ecological conditions of different locations. The control parameters are the migration and the tolerance of the strategies towards the environmental condition (location). Locally, population growth is logistic and selection is frequency-independent, corresponding to the case of a single limiting resource. The behaviour of the population is modelled by numerically integrated reaction-diffusion equations as well as by individual-based simulations. Limiting similarity, spatial niche segregation and character displacement are demonstrated, analogous to resource-heterogeneity based niche partitioning. Pairwise invasibility analysis reveals a convergent stable singular strategy optimized to the central, optimal location. It is evolutionarily stable if the migration rate and the tolerance are large. Decreasing migration or decreasing tolerance bifurcates the singular strategy to an evolutionary branching point. Individual-based simulation of evolution confirms that, in the case of branching singularity, evolution converges to this singular strategy and branches there. Depending on the environmental tolerance, further branching may occur. The branching evolution in the asexual model is interpreted as a sign that the ecology of an environmental gradient is prone to adaptive geographic speciation.",

      "abstractNote": "The genetic differentiation of populations in response to local selection pressures has long been studied by evolutionary biologists, but key details about the process remain obscure. How rapidly can local adaptation evolve, how extensive is the process across the genome, and how strong are the opposing forces of natural selection and gene flow? Here, we combine direct measurement of survival and reproduction with whole-genome genotyping of a plant species (Mimulus guttatus) that has recently invaded a novel habitat (the Quarry population). We renovate the classic selection component method to accommodate genomic data and observe selection at SNPs throughout the genome. SNPs showing viability selection in Quarry exhibit elevated divergence from neighboring populations relative to neutral SNPs. We also find that nonsignificant SNPs exhibit a subtle, but still significant, change in allele frequency toward neighboring populations, a predicted effect of gene flow. Given that the Quarry population is most probably only 30\u201340 generations old, the alleles conferring local advantage are almost certainly older than the population itself. Thus, local adaptation owes to the recruitment of standing genetic variation.",

      "abstractNote": "Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites in spatially structured populations can result in local adaptation of parasites1,2,3,4,5; that is, the greater infectivity of local parasites than foreign parasites on local hosts1. Such parasite specialization on local hosts has implications for human health and agriculture. By contrast with classic single-species population-genetic models6,7, theory indicates that parasite migration between subpopulations might increase parasite local adaptation, as long as migration does not completely homogenize populations8,9,10,11. To test this hypothesis we developed a system-specific mathematical model and then coevolved replicate populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and a parasitic bacteriophage with parasite only, with host only or with no migration. Here we show that patterns of local adaptation have considerable temporal and spatial variation and that, in the absence of migration, parasites tend to be locally maladapted. However, in accord with our model, parasite migration results in parasite local adaptation, but host migration alone has no significant effect.",

      "abstractNote": "In this article, we present a theoretical comparison of local adaptation between diploid and autotetraploid populations when fitness is determined by either additive or epistatic interactions between alleles at 2 loci. A continent-island model of local adaptation is derived, with 1-way migration from the continent to the island and distinct genotypes adaptive on the continent versus the island. The meiotic component of the model accounts for multivalent formation and the processes of chromosomal gametic disequilibrium and double reduction, which are unique to autotetraploids. Both the adaptability and efficiency of adaptation are investigated, where adaptability asks whether a population adapts and efficiency is the rate of adaptation. With an additive genetic basis to fitness, diploids experience better adaptability and efficiency than autotetraploids. With epistasis, our results indicate a limited parameter space in which autotetraploids have greater adaptability than diploids, but results indicate an interesting difference between adaptability and efficiency of adaptation. Oftentimes, diploids exhibit greater adaptability whereas autotetraploids exhibit greater efficiency of adaptation. These findings provide evidence for the advantage of epistasis within autotetraploids when efficiency of adaptation is of interest. Although autotetraploids are more efficient, under the same conditions and at equilibrium, diploid populations often have higher mean local fitness. Overall, the most ideal situation for autotetraploid local adaptation compared to diploids is when epistasis is strong, mutation is weak, recombination is high, selection is strong, deleterious selection is additive, chromosomal gametic disequilibrium is present, and double reduction is absent.",

      "abstractNote": "Under allopatric speciation, geographic barriers eliminate gene flow between eventual species at all loci in the genome simultaneously. There is increasing evidence, however, that speciation can be complex, with some loci experiencing gene flow during speciation or during bouts of secondary contact. In taxa with heteromorphic sex chromosomes\u2014birds, butterflies, mammals, and Drosophila\u2014the X (or Z) chromosome generally shows reduced levels of gene flow compared to autosomes. To investigate why, we develop population genetic models of secondary contact and gene flow at a neutral locus that is genetically linked to selected loci involved in hybrid incompatibilities and/or local adaptation. Using models that assume weak migration and strong selection, we compare gene flow at X-linked versus autosomal neutral loci as a function of linkage, dominance, sex-specific selection, and sex-specific recombination. For most cases, gene flow at neutral loci on the X is reduced relative to autosomes, as the greater efficacy of hemizygous selection in XY hybrids reduces the opportunity for neutral migrant alleles to escape their genetically linked, locally disfavored alleles via recombination. There are some circumstances, however, involving sex-limited selection and sex-limited recombination that allow neutral loci on the X to introgress more readily than those on autosomes.",

      "abstractNote": "A very general partial differential equation in space and time satisfied by the gene frequency in a monoecious population distributed continuously over an arbitrary habitat is derived. The treatment is restricted to a single diallelic locus in the absence of mutation and random drift, and it is supposed that time is continuous, births and deaths occur at random, and migration is independent of genotype. With the further assumptions that migration is isotropic and homogeneous, the population density is constant and uniform (as permitted by the population regulation mechanism included in the formulation), and Hardy-Weinberg proportions obtain locally, this partial differential equation reduces to the simplest multidimensional generalization of the classical Fisher-Haldane cline model. The efficacy of migration and selection in maintaining genetic variability at equilibrium in this model is investigated by deducing conditions for the existence of clines under various circumstances. The effects of the degree of dominance, a neutral belt between the regions where a particular allele is advantageous and deleterious, finiteness of the habitat, and habitat dimensionality are evaluated. Provided at least one of the alleles is favored only in a finite region, excluding the special case in which its total effective selective coefficient is zero, if conditions for supporting a cline are too unfavorable because migration is too strong, selection is too weak, or both, a cline cannot exist at all. Thus, unless there is overdominance, the population must be monomorphic. It is possible for a cline which can barely exist under the prevailing ecological circumstances to show a large amount of variation in gene frequency.",

      "abstractNote": "Two single-locus deterministic models are constructed for the maintenance of genetic variability in localised plant populations. In the first model, it is supposed that self-pollination is complete, heterozygotes are absent, and only seeds disperse. Then the ploidy is arbitrary. In the second, it is assumed that the plants are diploid, cross-pollination is total, and only pollen disperse. Explicit conditions for a protected polymorphism are derived for each model in the diallelic two-niche case. These conditions are simplified, displayed graphically, and discussed extensively for directional selection for different alleles in the two niches. If the amount of seed dispersal is divided by two, the criteria for a protected polymorphism in the self-pollinating scheme become identical to the criteria in the cross-pollinating situation with no multiplicative dominance. The restrictions that must be placed on the fitnesses for a protected polymorphism always become more stringent as the amount of dispersion increases. If the dispersion rate is not very close to zero and the selection coefficients are very small, the protection conditions reduce to overdominance for the mean fitnesses in the habitat. Unless there is complete dominance, protection always exists with fixed fitnesses for sufficiently low non-zero dispersal. For any amount of dispersion, there is always protection in the second model if, in each niche, the fitness of the deleterious homozygote is less than that of the heterozygote.",

      "abstractNote": "The evolution of the gene frequencies at a single multiallelic locus under the joint action of migration and selection is reviewed. The three models treated are in (1) discrete space and discrete time; (2) discrete space and continuous time; and (3) continuous space and continuous time. These models yield, respectively, a system of (1) nonlinear, first-order difference equations; (2) nonlinear, first-order differential equations; and (3) semilinear, parabolic partial differential equations. Among the questions discussed are the loss of a specified allele, the maintenance of a specified allele or every allele, the existence and stability of completely polymorphic equilibria, the weak- and strong-migration limits, and uniform (i.e., location-independent) selection. Many examples and unsolved problems are discussed.",

      "title": "Evolution under the multilocus Levene model without epistasis",
      "abstractNote": "Evolution under the multilocus Levene model is investigated. The linkage map is arbitrary, but epistasis is absent. The geometric-mean fitness, w\u0303(\u03c1), depends only on the vector of gene frequencies, \u03c1; it is nondecreasing, and the single-generation change is zero only on the set, \u039b, of gametic frequencies at gene-frequency equilibrium. The internal gene-frequency equilibria are the stationary points of w\u0303(\u03c1). If the equilibrium points \u03c1\u02c6 of \u03c1(t) (where t denotes time in generations) are isolated, as is generic, then \u03c1(t) converges as t\u2192\u221e to some \u03c1\u02c6. Generically, \u03c1(t) converges to a local maximum of w\u0303(\u03c1). Write the vector of gametic frequencies, p, as (\u03c1,d)T, where d represents the vector of linkage disequilibria. If \u03c1\u02c6 is a local maximum of w\u0303(\u03c1), then the equilibrium point (\u03c1\u02c6,0)T is asymptotically stable. If either there are only two loci or there is no dominance, then d(t)\u21920 globally as t\u2192\u221e. In the second case, w\u0303(\u03c1) has a unique maximum \u03c1\u02c6 and (\u03c1\u02c6,0)T is globally asymptotically stable. If underdominance and overdominance are excluded, and if at each locus, the degree of dominance is deme independent for every pair of alleles, then the following results also hold. There exists exactly one stable gene-frequency equilibrium (point or manifold), and it is globally attracting. If an internal gene-frequency equilibrium exists, it is globally asymptotically stable. On \u039b, (i)\u00a0the number of demes, \u0393, is a generic upper bound on the number of alleles present per locus; and (ii)\u00a0if every locus is diallelic, generically at most \u0393\u22121 loci can segregate. Finally, if migration and selection are completely arbitrary except that the latter is uniform (i.e., deme independent), then every uniform selection equilibrium is a migration-selection equilibrium and generically has the same stability as under pure selection.",

      "abstractNote": "A model for the evolution of the local averages of a quantitative character under migration, selection, and random genetic drift in a subdivided population is formulated and investigated. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the monoecious, diploid population mates at random in each deme. All three evolutionary forces are weak, but the migration pattern and the local population numbers are otherwise arbitrary. The character is determined by purely additive gene action and a stochastically independent environment; its distribution is Gaussian with a constant variance; and it is under Gaussian stabilizing selection with the same parameters in every deme. Linkage disequilibrium is neglected. Most of the results concern the covariances of the local averages. For a finite number of demes, explicit formulas are derived for (i) the asymptotic rate and pattern of convergence to equilibrium, (ii) the variance of a suitably weighted average of the local averages, and (iii) the equilibrium covariances when selection and random drift are much weaker than migration. Essentially complete analyses of equilibrium and convergence are presented for random outbreeding and site homing, the Levene and island models, the circular habitat and the unbounded linear stepping-stone model in the diffusion approximation, and the exact unbounded stepping-stone model in one and two dimensions.",

Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; mutation and random drift are neglected. The analysis is restricted to a diallelic autosomal locus. In contrast to the monoecious case, the protection criteria depend on the order of migration and selection; they become identical for adult and juvenile migration if both the male and female backward migration matrices are symmetric, or the migration or selection patterns in the two sexes are the same. The protection conditions are presented explicitly for the Levene model. A recessive allele is protected in a panmictic dioecious population if the unweighted average of the recessive-to-dominant fitness ratios in the two sexes exceeds unity.",

The monoecious, diploid population is subdivided into finitely many panmictic colonies that exchange adult migrants independently of genotype. The forward migration matrix is arbitrary, but time independent and ergodic (i.e., irreducible and aperiodic). Several examples of globally attracting multiallelic equilibria are presented. Migration can cause global fixation even if, without migration, there is a globally attracting multiallelic equilibrium in every colony. Migration can also cause the global fixation of an allele that, without migration, is eliminated in every colony. Without dominance, generically, the number of alleles present at equilibrium cannot exceed the number of colonies. Some general properties and examples of the Levene model are studied in detail. If in each colony there is either no dominance or, without migration, a globally attracting internal equilibrium, then there exists a globally attracting equilibrium with migration. Therefore, if an internal equilibrium exists, it is the global attractor.",

      "abstractNote": "Evolution and ecological diversification in a heterogeneous environment is driven by an often complex interplay between local adaptation and dispersal between different habitat types. Heterogeneous environments also easily generate source-sink dynamics of populations coupled by dispersal. It follows that local adaptation and possible adaptive radiation almost by necessity involves adaptation to a (pseudo-)sink habitat, which is considered unlikely. We here study a model of 'parapatric branching' with this special focus on the spatial ecology of the process. We find that evolutionary branching can display a sequence of alternating adaptations to the source or the sink. In some circumstances a true sink can become a pseudo-sink through adaptation to the corresponding source habitat. The evolutionary endpoint is a spatially structured community consisting of two source populations with one corresponding sink or pseudo-sink each. Our results shed new light on the interpretation of extant source-sink systems and the process of parapatric branching.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract. Much of the dynamics of coevolution may be driven by the interplay between geographic variation in reciprocal selection (selection mosaics) and the homogenizing action of gene flow. We develop a genetic model of geographically structured coevolution in which gene flow links coevolving communities that may differ in both the direction and magnitude of reciprocal selection. The results show that geographically structured coevolution may lead to allele-frequency clines within both interacting species when fitnesses are spatially uniform or spatially heterogeneous. Furthermore, the results show that the behavior and shape of clines differ dramatically among different types of coevolutionary interaction. Antagonistic interactions produce dynamic clines that change shape rapidly through time, producing shifting patterns of local adaptation and maladaptation. Unlike antagonistic interactions, mutualisms generate stable equilibrium patterns that lead to fixed spatial patterns of adaptation. Interactions that vary between mutualism and antagonism produce both equilibrium and dynamic clines. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that these interactions may allow mutualisms to persist throughout the geographic range of an interaction, despite pockets of locally antagonistic selection. In all cases, the coevolved spatial patterns of allele frequencies are sensitive to the relative contributions of gene flow, selection, and overall habitat size, indicating that the appropriate scale for studies of geographically structured coevolution depends on the relative contributions of each of these factors.",

      "abstractNote": "Many of the dynamic properties of coevolution may occur at the level of interacting populations, with local adaptation acting as a force of diversification, as migration between populations homogenizes these isolated interactions. This interplay between local adaptation and migration may be particularly important in structuring interactions that vary from mutualism to antagonism across the range of an interacting set of species, such as those between some plants and their insect herbivores, mammals and trypanosome parasites, and bacteria and plasmids that confer antibiotic resistance. Here we present a simple geographically structured genetic model of a coevolutionary interaction that varies between mutualism and antagonism among communities linked by migration. Inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow alters the outcomes of local interactions and allows the maintenance of allelic polymorphism across all communities under a range of selection intensities and rates of migration. Furthermore, inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow allows fixed mutualisms to be evolutionarily stable within both communities, even when selection on the interaction is antagonistic within one community. Moreover, the model demonstrates that the inclusion of geographic structure with gene flow may lead to considerable local maladaptation and trait mismatching as predicted by the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution.",

      "abstractNote": "A central prediction of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is that coevolving interspecific interactions will show varying degrees of local maladaptation. According to the theory, much of this local maladaptation is driven by selection mosaics and spatially intermingled coevolutionary hot and cold spots, rather than a simple balance between gene flow and selection. Here I develop a genetic model of host-parasite coevolution that is sufficiently general to incorporate selection mosaics, coevolutionary hot and cold spots, and a diverse array of genetic systems of infection/resistance. Results from this model show that the selection mosaics experienced by the interacting species are an important determinant of the sign and magnitude of local maladaptation. In some cases, this effect may be stronger than a previously described effect of relative rates of parasite and host gene flow. These results provide the first theoretical evidence that selection mosaics and coevolutionary hot and cold spots per se determine the magnitude and sign of local maladaptation. At the same time, however, these results demonstrate that coevolution in a geographic mosaic can lead to virtually any pattern of local adaptation or local maladaptation. Consequently, empirical studies that describe only patterns of local adaptation or maladaptation do not provide evidence either for or against the theory.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract: Studying the correlation between traits of interacting species has long been a popular approach for identifying putative cases of coevolution. More recently, such approaches have been used as a means to evaluate support for the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. Here we examine the utility of these approaches, using mathematical and computational models to predict the correlation that evolves between traits of interacting species for a broad range of interaction types. Our results reveal that coevolution is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the evolution of spatially correlated traits between two species. Specifically, our results show that coevolutionary selection fails to consistently generate statistically significant correlations and, conversely, that non\u2010coevolutionary processes can readily cause statistically significant correlations to evolve. In addition, our results demonstrate that studies of trait correlations per se cannot be used as evidence either for or against a geographic mosaic process. Taken together, our results suggest that understanding the coevolutionary process in natural populations will require detailed mechanistic studies conducted in multiple populations or the use of more sophisticated statistical approaches that better use information contained in existing data sets.",

      "abstractNote": "A Markovian extinction model that takes into account age structure of local populations allows consideration of the effects of demography and successional dynamics on the evolution of migration. Analytical expressions for the evolutionarily stable (ES) rates of dispersal are given for cases in which newly recolonized sites attain carrying capacity within a single season. Using a low-fecundity numerical model, we find that an increase of the level of site saturation increases the dispersal rate. Ecological successions and unequal local extinction rates between newly colonized sites and established populations strongly affect the ES dispersal rate. The frequency of genetic modifiers that enhance the rate of dispersal evolves negative correlations with deme age, with high-migration genotypes predominant among colonizers while progressively declining in frequency as a deme ages. This suggests that between-deme selection (colonization) favors migrants while within-deme selection favors low dispersers, which allows the coexistence of types with different dispersal rates. Because of the interaction between the two levels of selection, the relation between the ES dispersal rate and the deme maximal lifetime is nonmonotone. We suggest that life-history traits other than dispersal might also experience antagonistic selective forces at the between- and within-deme levels.",

      "abstractNote": "We use birdsong as a case study to ask whether reinforcement can occur via the spread of a genetically determined female preference for a socially inherited (learned) male trait. We envision secondary contact between two neighboring populations with different song dialects. An individual's ability to learn song is confined by a genetic predisposition: if predispositions are strong, there will be no phenotypic overlap in song between populations, whereas weak predispositions allow phenotypic overlap, or \"mixed\" song. To determine if reinforcement has occurred, we consider if an allele for within-population female mating preference, based on song, can spread, and whether population specific songs can concurrently be maintained at equilibrium. We model several scenarios, including costs to mating preferences, mating preferences in hybrids, and hybrids having the ability to learn pure songs. We find that when weak predispositions are fixed within a population reinforcement based on song cannot occur. However, when some individuals have strong predispositions, restricting phenotypic overlap between populations in the trait, reinforcement is only slightly inhibited from a purely genetic model. Generalizing beyond the example of song, we conclude that socially learned signals will tend to prohibit reinforcement, but it may still occur if some individuals acquire trait phenotypes genetically.",

      "abstractNote": "Key conceptual issues about speciation go unanswered without consideration of non-mutually exclusive factors. With tests based on speciation theory, we exploit the island distribution and habitat differences exhibited by the Caribbean cricket Amphiacusta sanctaecrucis, and with an analysis of divergent ecological selection, sexually selected differentiation and geographical isolation, address how these different factors interact. After testing for divergent selection by comparing neutral genetic and morphological divergence in one ecological (mandible shape) and one sexual (male genitalia shape) trait, we examine whether ecological or sexual selection is the primary mechanism driving population divergence. We find that all three factors-isolation, ecological and sexual selection-contribute to divergence, and that their interaction determines the stage of completeness achieved during the speciation process, as measured by patterns of genetic differentiation. Moreover, despite the striking diversity in genitalic shapes across the genus Amphiacusta, which suggests that sexual selection drives speciation, the significant differences in genitalia shape between forest habitats revealed here implies that ecological divergence may be the primary axis of divergence. Our work highlights critical unstudied aspects in speciation-differentiating the cause from the consequence of divergence-and suggests avenues for further disentangling the roles of natural and sexual selection in driving divergence in Amphiacusta.",

      "abstractNote": "AbstractReproductive mode may strongly impact adaptation in spatially varying populations linked by dispersal, especially when sexual and clonal offspring differ in dispersal. We determined how spatial structure affects adaptation in populations with mixed clonal and sexual reproduction. In a source-sink quantitative genetic deterministic model (with stabilizing selection around different optima), greater clonal reproduction or parent-offspring association (a measure of the part of the parent's phenotype other than the additive genetic component inherited by clonal offspring) increased the selective difference (difference between phenotypic optima) allowing sink populations to adapt. Given dispersal differences between clonally and sexually produced juveniles, adaptation increased with an increasing fraction of clonal dispersers. When considering migrational meltdown, partially clonal reproduction reduced cases where dispersal caused habitat loss. Stochastic individual-based simulations support these results, although the effect of differential dispersal was reversed, with decreased clonal dispersal allowing greater adaptation. These results parallel earlier findings that for an instantaneous shift in phenotypic optimum, increasing clonality allowed population persistence for a greater shift; here, selective change is spatial rather than temporal. These results may help explain the success of many partially clonal organisms in invading new habitats, complementing traditional explanations based on avoiding Allee effects.",

      "abstractNote": "We explore the evolution of dominance at polymorphisms maintained either by overdominant selection or by migration\u2010selection balance. At such balanced polymorphisms, heterozygotes remain at appreciable frequencies over long periods of time, allowing extensive modification of dominance to occur. The strength of selection favoring a modifier of dominance is roughly proportional to the probability that a modifier allele is found in a heterozygote at the locus subject to balancing selection times the heterozygote fitness increase caused by the modifier. Using a two\u2010locus model, we elucidate the interesting ways in which recombination and migration cause departures from this rough expectation. For example, with overdominance, a genetic association with the rarest allele favors a modifier that increases heterozygote fitness because the modifier occurs more often in heterozygotes. With migration\u2010selection balance, dominance evolves more readily in patches experiencing the strongest selection. We also find that, while there are more heterozygotes in sink populations (which have higher rates of immigration than emigration), selection for dominance in sink and source populations is nearly equal because sink populations make a lower genetic contribution to future generations. We conclude that the evolution of dominance is likely to occur whenever polymorphism is maintained by either overdominance or migration.",

      "title": "Frequency-Dependent Selection and the Evolution of Assortative Mating",
      "abstractNote": "A long-standing goal in evolutionary biology is to identify the conditions that promote the evolution of reproductive isolation and speciation. The factors promoting sympatric speciation have been of particular interest, both because it is notoriously difficult to prove empirically and because theoretical models have generated conflicting results, depending on the assumptions made. Here, we analyze the conditions under which selection favors the evolution of assortative mating, thereby reducing gene flow between sympatric groups, using a general model of selection, which allows fitness to be frequency dependent. Our analytical results are based on a two-locus diploid model, with one locus altering the trait under selection and the other locus controlling the strength of assortment (a \u201cone-allele\u201d model). Examining both equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios, we demonstrate that whenever heterozygotes are less fit, on average, than homozygotes at the trait locus, indirect selection for assortative mating is generated. While costs of assortative mating hinder the evolution of reproductive isolation, they do not prevent it unless they are sufficiently great. Assortative mating that arises because individuals mate within groups (formed in time or space) is most conducive to the evolution of complete assortative mating from random mating. Assortative mating based on female preferences is more restrictive, because the resulting sexual selection can lead to loss of the trait polymorphism and cause the relative fitness of heterozygotes to rise above homozygotes, eliminating the force favoring assortment. When assortative mating is already prevalent, however, sexual selection can itself cause low heterozygous fitness, promoting the evolution of complete reproductive isolation (akin to \u201creinforcement\u201d) regardless of the form of natural selection.",

      "abstractNote": "While it is well understood that the pace of evolution depends on the interplay between natural selection, random genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow, it is not always easy to disentangle the relative roles of these factors with data from natural populations. One popular approach to infer whether the observed degree of population differentiation has been influenced by local adaptation is the comparison of neutral marker gene differentiation (as reflected in FST) and quantitative trait divergence (as reflected in QST). However, this method may lead to compromised statistical power, because FST and QST are summary statistics which neglect information on specific pairs of populations, and because current multivariate tests of neutrality involve an averaging procedure over the traits. Further, most FST-QST comparisons actually replace QST by its expectation over the evolutionary process and are thus theoretically flawed. To overcome these caveats, we derived the statistical distribution of population means generated by random genetic drift and used the probability density of this distribution to test whether the observed pattern could be generated by drift alone. We show that our method can differentiate between genetic drift and selection as a cause of population differentiation even in cases with FST=QST and demonstrate with simulated data that it disentangles drift from selection more accurately than conventional FST-QST tests especially when data sets are small.",

      "abstractNote": "Anthropogenic climate change is an urgent threat to species diversity1,2. One aspect of this threat is the merging of species through increased hybridization3. The primary mechanism for this collapse is thought to be the weakening of ecologically mediated reproductive barriers, as demonstrated in cases of \u2018reverse speciation\u20194,5. Here, we expand on this idea and show that adaptive introgression between species adapting to a shared, moving climatic optimum can readily weaken any reproductive barrier, including those that are completely independent of climate. Using genetically explicit forward-time simulations, we show that genetic linkage between alleles conferring adaptation to a changing climate and alleles conferring reproductive isolation (intrinsic and/or non-climatic extrinsic) can lead to adaptive introgression facilitating the homogenization of reproductive isolation alleles. This effect causes the decay of species boundaries across a broad and biologically realistic parameter space. We explore how the magnitude of this effect depends on the rate of climate change, the genetic architecture of adaptation, the initial degree of reproductive isolation, the degree to which reproductive isolation is intrinsic versus extrinsic and the mutation rate. These results highlight a previously unexplored effect of rapid climate change on species diversity. Increased hybridization has the potential to threaten species diversity. Here population genetic computer simulations show that climate-induced adaptive introgression could readily lead to hybridization even when reproductive isolation is independent from climate.",

      "abstractNote": "A Fisherian model of sexual selection is combined with a diffusion model of mate dispersal to investigate the evolution of assortative mating in a sympatric population. Females mate with one of two types of polygynous males according to a male's display of one of two sex-limited, autosomal traits; these male traits may be associated with differential phenotypic mortalities. Through a Fisherian runaway process, female preferences and male traits can become associated in linkage disequilibrium, leading to patterns of assortative mating. Dispersing males, whose rate of movement is dependent on mating success, carry female preference genes with them, and displaced males thereby produce daughters with preference genes for their respective traits in locally higher than average frequencies. The reduced diffusion of the more preferred males permits the success of other male types in adjacent areas. Thus, mating-success dependent diffusion, when coupled with the rapid divergence in phenotypes possible under the Fisher process, can lead to the coexistence of two female preferences and two male traits in sympatry. We argue that many existing approaches to sympatric speciation fail to explain observed male polymorphisms because they exclude explicit spatial structure from their speciation models.",

      "title": "Dominance and the maintenance of polymorphism in multiallelic migration-selection models with two demes",
      "abstractNote": "The maintenance of genetic variation in a spatially heterogeneous environment has been one of the main research themes in theoretical population genetics. Despite considerable progress in understanding the consequences of spatially structured environments on genetic variation, many problems remain unsolved. One of them concerns the relationship between the number of demes, the degree of dominance, and the maximum number of alleles that can be maintained by selection in a subdivided population. In this work, we study the potential of maintaining genetic variation in a two-deme model with deme-independent degree of intermediate dominance, which includes absence of G\u00d7E interaction as a special case. We present a thorough numerical analysis of a two-deme three-allele model, which allows us to identify dominance and selection patterns that harbor the potential for stable triallelic equilibria. The information gained by this approach is then used to construct an example in which existence and asymptotic stability of a fully polymorphic equilibrium can be proved analytically. Noteworthy, in this example the parameter range in which three alleles can coexist is maximized for intermediate migration rates. Our results can be interpreted in a specialist\u2013generalist context and (among others) show when two specialists can coexist with a generalist in two demes if the degree of dominance is deme independent and intermediate. The dominance relation between the generalist allele and the specialist alleles play a decisive role. We also discuss linear selection on a quantitative trait and show that G\u00d7E interaction is not necessary for the maintenance of more than two alleles in two demes.",

      "abstractNote": "Several recent models have shown that frequency\u2010dependent disruptive selection created by intraspecific competition can lead to the evolution of assortative mating and, thus, to competitive sympatric speciation. However, since most of these results rely on limited numerical analyses, their generality has been debated. Here, we consider one of the standard models (the so\u2010called Roughgarden model) with a simplified genetics where the selected trait is determined by a single diallelic locus. This model is sufficiently complex to maintain key properties of the general multilocus case but simple enough to allow for comprehensive analytical treatment by means of invasion fitness arguments. Depending on (1) the strength and (2) the shape of stabilizing selection, (3) the strength and (4) the shape of pairwise competition, (5) the shape of the mating function, and (6) whether assortative mating leads to sexual selection, we find five different evolutionary regimes. In one of these regimes, complete reproductive isolation can evolve through arbitrarily small steps in the strength of assortative mating. Our approach provides a mechanistic understanding of several phenomena that have been found in previous models. The results demonstrate how even in a simple model, the evolutionary outcome depends in a complex way on ecological and genetic parameters.",

      "abstractNote": "The causes and consequences of fluctuating population densities are an important topic in ecological literature. Yet, the effects of such fluctuations on maintenance of variation in spatially structured populations have received little analytic treatment. We analyze what happens when two habitats coupled by migration not only differ in their trade-offs in selection but also in their demographic stability\u2014and show that equilibrium allele frequencies can change significantly due to ecological feedback arising from locally fluctuating population sizes. When an ecological niche exhibits such fluctuations, these drive an asymmetry in the relative impact of gene flow, and therefore, the equilibrium frequency of the locally adapted type decreases. Our results extend the classic conditions on maintenance of diversity under selection and migration by including the effect of fluctuating population densities. We find simple analytic conditions in terms of the strength of selection, immigration, and the extent of fluctuations between generations in a continent-island model. Although weak fluctuations hardly affect coexistence, strong recurrent fluctuations lead to extinction of the type better adapted to the fluctuating niche\u2014even if the invader is locally maladapted. There is a disadvantage to specialization to an unstable habitat, as it makes the population vulnerable to swamping from more stable habitats.",

      "title": "Limits to adaptation along environmental gradients",
      "abstractNote": "Why do species\u2019 ranges often end when no obvious change in the environment suggests they should? Our theory explains that there is an inherent limit to adaptation arising in any (finite) natural population and identifies the key parameters that determine this limit to a species\u2019 range. Two observable parameters describe the threshold when adaptation fails: (i) the loss of fitness due to dispersal to a different environment, and (ii) the efficacy of selection relative to stochastic effects in finite populations., Why do species not adapt to ever-wider ranges of conditions, gradually expanding their ecological niche and geographic range? Gene flow across environments has two conflicting effects: although it increases genetic variation, which is a prerequisite for adaptation, gene flow may swamp adaptation to local conditions. In 1956, Haldane proposed that, when the environment varies across space, \u201cswamping\u201d by gene flow creates a positive feedback between low population size and maladaptation, leading to a sharp range margin. However, current deterministic theory shows that, when variance can evolve, there is no such limit. Using simple analytical tools and simulations, we show that genetic drift can generate a sharp margin to a species\u2019 range, by reducing genetic variance below the level needed for adaptation to spatially variable conditions. Aided by separation of ecological and evolutionary timescales, the identified effective dimensionless parameters reveal a simple threshold that predicts when adaptation at the range margin fails. Two observable parameters determine the threshold: (i) the effective environmental gradient, which can be measured by the loss of fitness due to dispersal to a different environment; and (ii) the efficacy of selection relative to genetic drift. The theory predicts sharp range margins even in the absence of abrupt changes in the environment. Furthermore, it implies that gradual worsening of conditions across a species\u2019 habitat may lead to a sudden range fragmentation, when adaptation to a wide span of conditions within a single species becomes impossible.",

      "abstractNote": "More than 100 years after Grigg\u2019s influential analysis of species\u2019 borders, the causes of limits to species\u2019 ranges still represent a puzzle that has never been understood with clarity. The topic has become especially important recently as many scientists have become interested in the potential for species\u2019 ranges to shift in response to climate change\u2014and yet nearly all of those studies fail to recognise or incorporate evolutionary genetics in a way that relates to theoretical developments. I show that range margins can be understood based on just two measurable parameters: (i) the fitness cost of dispersal\u2014a measure of environmental heterogeneity\u2014and (ii) the strength of genetic drift, which reduces genetic diversity. Together, these two parameters define an \u2018expansion threshold\u2019: adaptation fails when genetic drift reduces genetic diversity below that required for adaptation to a heterogeneous environment. When the key parameters drop below this expansion threshold locally, a sharp range margin forms. When they drop below this threshold throughout the species\u2019 range, adaptation collapses everywhere, resulting in either extinction or formation of a fragmented metapopulation. Because the effects of dispersal differ fundamentally with dimension, the second parameter\u2014the strength of genetic drift\u2014is qualitatively different compared to a linear habitat. In two-dimensional habitats, genetic drift becomes effectively independent of selection. It decreases with \u2018neighbourhood size\u2019\u2014the number of individuals accessible by dispersal within one generation. Moreover, in contrast to earlier predictions, which neglected evolution of genetic variance and/or stochasticity in two dimensions, dispersal into small marginal populations aids adaptation. This is because the reduction of both genetic and demographic stochasticity has a stronger effect than the cost of dispersal through increased maladaptation. The expansion threshold thus provides a novel, theoretically justified, and testable prediction for formation of the range margin and collapse of the species\u2019 range.",

      "abstractNote": "Changes in the seasonal timing of life history events are documented effects of climate change. We used a general model to study how dispersal and competitive interactions affect eco-evolutionary responses to changes in the temporal distribution of resources over the season. Specifically, we modeled adaptation of the timing of reproduction and population dynamic responses in two competing populations that disperse between two habitats characterized by an early and late resource peak. We investigated three scenarios of environmental change: (1) food peaks advance in both habitats, (2) in the late habitat only and (3) in the early habitat only. At low dispersal rates the evolutionarily stable timing of reproduction closely matched the local resource peak and the environmental change typically caused population decline. Larger dispersal rates rendered less intuitive eco-evolutionary population responses. First, dispersal caused mismatch between evolutionarily stable timing of reproduction and local resource peaks and as a result, reproductive output for subpopulations could increase as well as decrease when resource availability underwent temporal shifts. Second, population responses were contingent on competition between populations. This could accelerate population declines and cause extinctions or even reverse population trends from negative to positive compared to the low dispersal case. When dispersal rate was large and the early resource peak was advanced available niche space was reduced. Hence, even when a population survived the environmental change and obtained positive equilibrium population density, subsequent adaptation of competing populations could drive it to extinction due to convergent evolution and competitive exclusion. These results shed new light on the role of competition and dispersal for the evolution of timing of life history events and provide guidelines for understanding short and long-term population response to climate change.",

      "abstractNote": "Several theoretical studies of niche breadth evolution have shown that niche breadth expansion can only occur under a limited set of conditions. These studies have assumed that mating pairs form at random within spatial subpopulations. I show here that nonrandom mating within spatial subpopulations can greatly alter niche breadth evolution. Niche breadth expansion is restricted by assortative mating but is permitted by sexual selection. When new populations are formed by a single pulse of immigrants, the ability to persist in novel but similar environments is enhanced by sexual selection. When new populations receive a constant stream of immigrants, sexual selection allows the evolution of increased niche breadth even when the novel environment is very different from the ancestral environment. These results suggest that species lineages that exhibit sexual selection will have broader niches than species lineages that mate randomly or assortatively.",

      "abstractNote": "Gene flow between populations adapting to differing local environmental conditions might be costly because individuals can disperse to habitats where their survival is low or because they can reproduce with locally maladapted individuals. The amount by which the mean relative population fitness is kept below one creates an opportunity for modifiers of the genetic architecture to spread due to selection. Prior work that separately considered modifiers changing dispersal, recombination rates, or altering dominance or epistasis, has typically focused on the direction of selection rather than its absolute magnitude. We here develop methods to determine the strength of selection on modifiers of the genetic architecture, including modifiers of the dispersal rate, in populations that have previously evolved local adaptation. We consider scenarios with up to five loci contributing to local adaptation and derive a new model for the deterministic spread of modifiers. We find that selection for modifiers of epistasis and dominance is stronger than selection for decreased recombination, and that selection for partial reductions in recombination are extremely weak, regardless of the number of loci contributing to local adaptation. The spread of modifiers that reduce dispersal depends on the number of loci, epistasis and extent of local adaptation in the ancestral population. We identify a novel effect, that modifiers of dominance are more strongly selected when they are unlinked to the locus that they modify. These findings help explain population differentiation and reproductive isolation and provide a benchmark to compare selection on modifiers under finite population sizes and demographic stochasticity.",

      "abstractNote": "We use modifier theory to compare the evolution of recombination under mutation-selection and migration-selection balance models. Recombination between loosely linked loci subject to weak multilocus selection is controlled by the genotype at a selectively neutral modifier locus. We show that the success of a new modifier depends on the sign and amount of epistasis as well as on the linkage of the modifier locus to the loci under selection. With both migration and mutation, for recombination to increase requires negative (synergistic) epistasis. When epistasis is sufficiently weak, increased recombination is always favoured under mutation-selection balance and never under migration-selection balance. With stronger negative epistasis, there exists a critical recombination value. In this case, a recombination-increasing allele invades the population under mutation-selection balance if its recombination rate with the major loci is less than the critical recombination value, whereas with weak migration it must be above this value. These results are the same for haploid and diploid populations.",

      "title": "Convergent Evolution During Local Adaptation to Patchy Landscapes",
      "abstractNote": "Species often encounter, and adapt to, many patches of similar environmental conditions across their range. Such adaptation can occur through convergent evolution if different alleles arise in different patches, or through the spread of shared alleles by migration acting to synchronize adaptation across the species. The tension between the two reflects the constraint imposed on evolution by the underlying genetic architecture versus how effectively selection and geographic isolation act to inhibit the geographic spread of locally adapted alleles. This paper studies the balance between these two routes to adaptation in a model of continuous environments with patchy selection pressures. We address the following questions: How long does it take for a novel allele to appear in a patch where it is locally adapted through mutation? Or, through migration from another, already adapted patch? Which is more likely to occur, as a function of distance between the patches? What population genetic signal is left by the spread of migrant alleles? To answer these questions we examine the family structure underlying migration-selection equilibrium surrounding an already adapted patch, treating those rare families that reach new patches as spatial branching processes. A main result is that patches further apart than a critical distance will likely evolve independent locally adapted alleles; this distance is proportional to the spatial scale of selection (sigma/root s(m), where s is the dispersal distance and s(m) is the selective disadvantage of these alleles between patches), and depends linearly on log(s(m)/mu), where mu is the mutation rate. This provides a way to understand the role of geographic separation between patches in promoting convergent adaptation and the genomic signals it leaves behind. We illustrate these ideas using the convergent evolution of cryptic coloration in the rock pocket mouse, Chaetodipus intermedius, as an empirical example.",

      "abstractNote": "The extent to which populations experiencing shared selective pressures adapt through a shared genetic response is relevant to many questions in evolutionary biology. In this article, we explore how standing genetic variation contributes to convergent genetic responses in a geographically spread population. Geographically limited dispersal slows the spread of each selected allele, hence allowing other alleles to spread before any one comes to dominate the population. When selectively equivalent alleles meet, their progress is substantially slowed, dividing the species range into a random tessellation, which can be well understood by analogy to a Poisson process model of crystallization. In this framework, we derive the geographic scale over which an allele dominates and the proportion of adaptive alleles that arise from standing variation. Finally, we explore how negative pleiotropic effects of alleles can bias the subset of alleles that contribute to the species' adaptive response. We apply the results to the malaria-resistance glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficiency alleles, where the large mutational target size makes it a likely candidate for adaptation from deleterious standing variation. Our results suggest that convergent adaptation may be common. Therefore, caution must be exercised when arguing that strongly geographically restricted alleles are the outcome of local adaptation. We close by discussing the implications of these results for ideas of species coherence and the nature of divergence between species.",

      "abstractNote": "Landscape genomics is an emerging research field that aims to identify the environmental factors that shape adaptive genetic variation and the gene variants that drive local adaptation. Its development has been facilitated by next-generation sequencing, which allows for screening thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms in many individuals and populations at reasonable costs. In parallel, data sets describing environmental factors have greatly improved and increasingly become publicly accessible. Accordingly, numerous analytical methods for environmental association studies have been developed. Environmental association analysis identifies genetic variants associated with particular environmental factors and has the potential to uncover adaptive patterns that are not discovered by traditional tests for the detection of outlier loci based on population genetic differentiation. We review methods for conducting environmental association analysis including categorical tests, logistic regressions, matrix correlations, general linear models and mixed effects models. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches, provide a list of dedicated software packages and their specific properties, and stress the importance of incorporating neutral genetic structure in the analysis. We also touch on additional important aspects such as sampling design, environmental data preparation, pooled and reduced-representation sequencing, candidate-gene approaches, linearity of allele\u2013environment associations and the combination of environmental association analyses with traditional outlier detection tests. We conclude by summarizing expected future directions in the field, such as the extension of statistical approaches, environmental association analysis for ecological gene annotation, and the need for replication and post hoc validation studies.",

      "abstractNote": "A simulation model was constructed to investigate the evolution of reproductive isolation between habitat specialists when disruptive selection was applied to habitat preference. Disruptive selection favored individuals that selected either end of a gradient of nine habitat patch types. Habitat preference was assumed to be controlled by four additive unlinked loci. In different simulations it was assumed that habitat preference pleiotropically produced varying levels of partial assortative mating between individuals with similar habitat preference. The simulations indicated a strong interaction between the processes of disruptive selection and habitat-based assortative mating. Moderate levels of either disruptive selection or habitat-based assortative mating, when operating alone, resulted in the evolution of little or no reproductive isolation between the subpopulations genetically disposed to utilize each of the selected habitats. When these two factors were applied together there was a marked increase in the development of reproductive isolation that could not be explained by the additive effects of each factor. The genetic mechanism producing this interaction appears to be the reversal of an antagonistic interaction between the processes of selection and recombination that typically interferes with the evolution of reproductive isolation under sympatric conditions.",

      "abstractNote": "The extent to which parasites are locally adapted to their hosts has important implications for human health and agriculture. A recently developed conceptual framework--the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution--predicts that local maladaptation should be common and largely determined by the interplay between gene flow and spatially variable reciprocal selection. Previous investigation of this theory has predominately focused on genetic systems of infection and resistance characterized by few genes of major effect and particular forms of epistasis. Here we extend existing theory by analyzing mathematical models of host-parasite interactions in which host resistance to parasites is mediated by quantitative traits with an additive polygenic basis. In contrast to previous theoretical studies predicated upon major gene mechanisms, we find that parasite local maladaptation is quite uncommon and restricted to one specific functional form of host resistance. Furthermore, our results show that local maladaptation should be rare or absent in studies that measure local adaptation using reciprocal transplant designs conducted in natural environments. Our results thus narrow the scope over which the predictions of the geographic mosaic theory are likely to hold and provide novel and readily testable predictions about when and where local maladaptation is expected.",

      "abstractNote": "We consider the evolution of ecological specialization in a landscape with two discrete habitat types connected by migration, for example, a plant-insect system with two plant hosts. Using a quantitative genetic approach. we study the joint evolution of a quantitative character determining performance in each habitat together with the changes in the population density. We find that specialization on a single habitat evolves with intermediate migration rates, whereas a generalist species evolves with both very low and very large rates of movement between habitats. There is a threshold at which a small increase in the connectivity of the two habitats will result in dramatic decrease in the total population size and the nearly complete loss of use of one of the two habitats through a process of \"migrational meltdown.\" In some situations, equilibria corresponding to a specialist and a generalist species are simultaneously stable. Analysis of our model also shows cases of hysteresis in which small transient changes in the landscape structure or accidental demographic disturbances have irreversible effects on the evolution of specialization.",

      "abstractNote": "Assortative mating is an important driver of speciation in populations with gene flow and is predicted to evolve under certain conditions in few-locus models. However, the evolution of assortment is less understood for mating based on quantitative traits, which are often characterized by high genetic variability and extensive linkage disequilibrium between trait loci. We explore this scenario for a two-deme model with migration, by considering a single polygenic trait subject to divergent viability selection across demes, as well as assortative mating and sexual selection within demes, and investigate how trait divergence is shaped by various evolutionary forces. Our analysis reveals the existence of sharp thresholds of assortment strength, at which divergence increases dramatically. We also study the evolution of assortment via invasion of modifiers of mate discrimination and show that the ES assortment strength has an intermediate value under a range of migration-selection parameters, even in diverged populations, due to subtle effects which depend sensitively on the extent of phenotypic variation within these populations. The evolutionary dynamics of the polygenic trait is studied using the hypergeometric and infinitesimal models. We further investigate the sensitivity of our results to the assumptions of the hypergeometric model, using individual-based simulations.",

      "abstractNote": "We analyse how migration from a large mainland influences genetic load and population numbers on an island, in a scenario where fitness-affecting variants are unconditionally deleterious, and where numbers decline with increasing load. Our analysis shows that migration can have qualitatively different effects, depending on the total mutation target and fitness effects of deleterious variants. In particular, we find that populations exhibit a genetic Allee effect across a wide range of parameter combinations, when variants are partially recessive, cycling between low-load (large-population) and high-load (sink) states. Increased migration reduces load in the sink state (by increasing heterozygosity) but further inflates load in the large-population state (by hindering purging). We identify various critical parameter thresholds at which one or other stable state collapses, and discuss how these thresholds are influenced by the genetic versus demographic effects of migration. Our analysis is based on a \u2018semi-deterministic\u2019 analysis, which accounts for genetic drift but neglects demographic stochasticity. We also compare against simulations which account for both demographic stochasticity and drift. Our results clarify the importance of gene flow as a key determinant of extinction risk in peripheral populations, even in the absence of ecological gradients.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue \u2018Species\u2019 ranges in the face of changing environments (part I)\u2019.",

      "abstractNote": "Formation of partially reproductively isolated ecotypes in the rough periwinkle, Littorina saxatilis, may be a case of incipient nonallopatric ecological speciation. To better understand the dynamics of ecotype formation, its timescale, driving forces and evolutionary consequences, we developed a spatially explicit, individual-based model incorporating relevant ecological, spatial and mate selection data for Swedish L. saxatilis. We explore the impact of bounded hybrid superiority, ecological scenarios and mate selection systems on ecotype formation, gene flow and the evolution of prezygotic isolation. Our model shows that ecotypes are expected to form rapidly in parapatry under conditions applicable to Swedish L. saxatilis and may proceed to speciation. However, evolution of nonrandom mating had complex behaviour. Ecotype evolution was inhibited by pre-existing mating preferences, but facilitated by the evolution of novel preferences. While in many scenarios positive assortative mating reduced gene flow between ecotypes, in others negative assortative mating arose, preferences were lost after ecotype formation, preferences were confined to one ecotype or the ancestral ecotype became extinct through sexual selection. Bounded hybrid superiority (as observed in nature) enhanced ecotype formation but increased gene flow. Our results highlight that ecotype formation and speciation are distinct processes: factors that contribute to ecotype formation can be detrimental to speciation and vice versa. The complex interactions observed between local adaptation and nonrandom mating imply that generalization from data is unreliable without quantitative theory for speciation.",

      "abstractNote": "Fitness is a central concept in evolutionary biology, but there is no unified definition. We review recent theoretical developments showing that including fluctuating environments and density dependence has important implications for how differences among phenotypes in their contributions to future generations should be quantified. The rate of phenotypic evolution will vary through time because of environmental stochasticity. Density dependence may produce fluctuating selection for large growth rates at low densities but for larger carrying capacities when population sizes are large. In general, including ecologically realistic assumptions when defining the concept of fitness is crucial for estimating the potential of evolutionary rescue of populations affected by environmental perturbations such as climate change.",

      "abstractNote": "Host-parasite antagonistic interaction has been proposed as a potential agent to promote genetic polymorphism and to favour sex against asex, despite its twofold cost in reproduction. However, the host-parasite gene-for-gene dynamics often produce unstable cycles that tend to destroy genetic diversity. Here, we examine such diversity destroying coevolutionary dynamics of host and parasite, which is coupled through local or global migration, or both, between demes in a metapopulation structure. We show that, with global migration in the island model, peculiar out-of-phase islands spontaneously arise in the cluster of islands converging to a global synchrony. Such asynchrony induced by the 'pacemaker islands' serves to restore genetic variation. With increasing fraction of local migration, spots of asynchrony are converted into loci or foci of spiral and target patterns, whose rotating arms then cover the majority of demes. A multi-locus analogue of the model reproduces the same tendency toward asynchrony, and the condition arises for an advantage of asexual clones over their sexual counterpart when enough genetic diversity is maintained through metapopulation storage-migration serves as a cheap alternative to sex.",

These are not often possible, but good surrogate approaches can be found in other types of common environmental experiments.Until now, the genetic basis of local adaptation has been studied in traits with simple inheritance and in model organisms with well-developed genomic resources.The end results of selection for adaptation to specific environmental conditions can be studied in isolated populations, in the framework that is designed for those conditions.If the process of local adaptation owing to migration\u2013selection balance is to be studied, then populations that are connected by ongoing gene flow need to be studied.Most plant studies suggest that the majority of polygenic adaptive traits are influenced by many loci with small effects, with contributions from only a few loci with larger effects. In forest trees, hardly any large-effect loci have been detected.Most animal studies have concentrated on adaptation based on distinct phenotypic polymorphisms, with monogenic or oligogenic inheritance. Genetic variation in polygenic traits has been less studied, but results on human height, for example, suggest small effects in many loci.Combining different phenotype and population genetics approaches using an explicit theoretical framework can provide strong total evidence even if individual methods are not conclusive, for example, when identifying loci under selection.",

      "title": "The genetics of phenotypic plasticity. VII. Evolution in a spatially-structured environment",
      "abstractNote": "Previous models of the evolution of phenotypic plasticity have, for the most part, not considered the effects of genetic architecture and spatial structure. I examine those factors with an individual-based simulation model. With regard to genetic architecture, I considered how the presence of different types of loci would affect medium-term evolutionary outcomes. The types of loci differed in how the environment determined phenotypic expression and included loci that were insensitive to the environment (non-plastic loci), sensitive in a linear fashion, and sensitive in a quadratic fashion (both plastic loci). With regard to spatial structure, I investigated the affects of migration patterns. These simulations demonstrated that two general conditions are necessary for phenotypic plasticity to be selected. (1) The environment must have a strong influence on genotypic expression. (2) The between-generation changes in the environment must be large and predictable, in the current instance because of migration in a spatially-structured (clinal) environment. Responses to selection were not simple, however. Rarely were pure strategies \u2014 genetic specialization or phenotypic plasticity \u2014 selected for. Instead, the existence of multiple types of loci led to mixed genetic outcomes. The result of this mixed outcome were individuals with reaction norms that were less steep than the optimal reaction norm (when non-plastic and linear-plastic loci were present) or individuals with curved reaction norms when the optimal reaction norms was linear (when all three types of loci were present). A pure plasticity strategy had the highest global fitness because plastic individuals would match the optimal phenotype everywhere. The reason that the metapopulation did not achieve this global fitness optimum is that local selection is stronger than global selection. Each deme is driven to a local fitness peak based on the combined, locally additive effects of the non-plastic and plastic loci. Plasticity is only selected globally, so plasticity becomes more highly favored with high migration rates. This effect was greatest in parts of the cline where the plasticity loci were not being expressed and, thus, not locally selected upon. That is, in these demes local selection was weak or absent allowing global fitness effects to predominate.",

      "abstractNote": "Dispersal is a key determinant of a population's evolutionary potential. It facilitates the propagation of beneficial alleles throughout the distributional range of spatially outspread populations and increases the speed of adaptation. However, when habitat is heterogeneous and individuals are locally adapted, dispersal may, at the same time, reduce fitness through increasing maladaptation. Here, we use a spatially explicit, allelic simulation model to quantify how these equivocal effects of dispersal affect a population's evolutionary response to changing climate. Individuals carry a diploid set of chromosomes, with alleles coding for adaptation to non-climatic environmental conditions and climatic conditions, respectively. Our model results demonstrate that the interplay between gene flow and habitat heterogeneity may decrease effective dispersal and population size to such an extent that substantially reduces the likelihood of evolutionary rescue. Importantly, even when evolutionary rescue saves a population from extinction, its spatial range following climate change may be strongly narrowed, that is, the rescue is only partial. These findings emphasize that neglecting the impact of non-climatic, local adaptation might lead to a considerable overestimation of a population's evolvability under rapid environmental change.",

      "abstractNote": "Several evolutionary processes shape the genetic and phenotypic differentiation of populations. Among them, the joint effects of gene flow, selection and phenotypic plasticity are poorly known, especially when trying to understand how maladaptive plasticity affects population divergence. We extended a quantitative genetic model of Hendry et al. (2001) to describe these joint effects on phenotypic and additive genetic divergence between two populations, and their phenotypic and genetic differentiation (PST and QST). With individual-based simulations, we tested our model predictions and further modeled allelic differentiation at neutral (FST) and adaptive (FSTQ) loci. While adaptive phenotypic plasticity allows for large phenotypic divergence and differentiation despite high gene flow, maladaptive plasticity promotes genetic divergence and generates countergradient variation, under extensive migration with phenotypic differences sometimes opposed to genetic differences. Maladaptive plasticity can also promote adaptive phenotypic divergence by reducing the effective gene flow. Overall, plasticity decouples genetic from phenotypic differences between populations, and blurs the correlation between phenotypic divergence and local adaptation. By deriving models of population differentiation for three different life cycles, we further describe the effect of a species\u2019 ecology on evolution in structured populations.",

If outcrossed progeny are less well-adapted to the parental environment than inbred progeny, but perform better in environments different from that of the parent, then the fitness of inbred progeny relative to outcrossed progeny should decrease with dispersal distance from the parent. To test these predictions, we collected seedlings at 10-m intervals from a 40 x 40-m permanent grid in a natural population of Impatiens capensis, grew them in a greenhouse, and crossed them to produce outcrossed chasmogamous seeds. Seedlings from outcrossed chasmogamous and self-fertilized cleistogamous seeds were planted back into the source population in the original site of their maternal parents and in arcs 3 and 12 m from the parental location and censused weekly for survival and reproduction. The fitness of inbred offspring declined significantly and the magnitude of observed inbreeding depression increased with distance from the parental site, supporting the local adaptation hypothesis.",

Frequency-dependent selection is due to intraspecific competition mediated by a quantitative character under stabilizing or directional selection. Assortment is induced by the same trait. We analyze the equilibrium structure and the local stability properties of all possible equilibria. In the limit of weak selection we obtain global stability properties by finding a Lyapunov function. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the maintenance of polymorphism in terms of the strength of stabilizing selection, intraspecific competition and assortment. Our results also include criteria for the ability of extreme types to invade the population.

      "title": "Does competitive divergence occur if assortative mating is costly?",
      "abstractNote": "Most models of sympatric speciation have assumed that assortative mating has no costs. A few studies, however, have shown that the costs for being choosy can prevent such speciation. Here, we investigate the role of the strength of assortment and of the costs for being choosy for a simple genetic model of a single (\u2018magic\u2019) trait that mediates both intraspecific competition for a continuum of resources and assortative mating, which is induced by choosy females who preferentially mate with males of similar phenotype. Choosiness may be costly if it is difficult to find a mating partner. Such magic trait models are considered to be most conducive of sympatric speciation. We consider a sexually reproducing population of haploid individuals that is density regulated. The trait is determined by a single locus with multiple alleles. The strength of stabilizing selection (caused by a unimodal resource distribution), the strength of competition, the degree of assortment and the costs for being choosy are independent parameters. We investigate analytically and numerically how these parameters determine the equilibrium and stability structure. In particular, we identify conditions under which no polymorphism at all is maintained as well as conditions under which strong competitive divergence occurs, or the population even splits into two reproductively isolated classes of highly diverse phenotypes. If costs are absent or moderate, genetic variability tends to be minimized at intermediate strengths of assortment, and reproductively isolated classes of phenotypes are a likely result of evolution only for intermediate or strong competition and for very strong assortment. The likelihood of divergence depends relatively weakly on the costs as long as they are not high. With high costs, however, increasingly strong assortment rapidly depletes all genetic variation, and strong competitive divergence is prevented.",

      "abstractNote": "Landscape genetics is the amalgamation of population genetics and landscape ecology (see Manel et al. 2003; Storfer et al. 2007). In Chapter 17, we discuss landscape genetics and provide two examples of applications in the area of modeling population connectivity and inferring fragmentation. These examples, like virtually all extant landscape genetic analyses, were based on evaluating spatial genetic patterns using a relatively small number of selectively neutral (or nearly neutral) markers. Landscape genomics, on the other hand, is the simultaneous study of tens-to-hundreds of markers, ideally including markers in candidate adaptive genes (genes under selection), with georeferenced samples collected across a landscape. While landscape genomics is, in one sense, simply landscape genetics with lots of data (thus reduced variance and increased precision), the qualitatively different (adaptive, potentially non-independent) nature and analytical approaches associated with these data are different enough to produce a profoundly different field.",

      "abstractNote": "The pronounced and elaborate displays that often differ between closely related animal species have led to the common assumption that sexual selection is important in speciation, especially in geographically separated populations. We use population genetic models to examine the ability of Fisherian sexual selection to contribute to lasting species differentiation by isolating its effect after the onset of gene flow between allopatric populations. We show that when sexually selected traits are under ecologically divergent selection, the situation most favorable to speciation, mating preferences tend to introgress faster than trait alleles, causing sexual selection to counter the effects of local adaptation. As a consequence, the net amount of trait divergence often drops with stronger Fisherian sexual selection. Furthermore, alleles for progressively weaker preferences spread in this context until sexual selection is removed. The effects of pure Fisherian sexual selection on species maintenance are thus much more inhibitory than previously assumed.",

      "abstractNote": "\u201cMagic traits,\u201d in which the same trait is both under divergent ecological selection and forms the basis of assortative mating, have been sought after due to their supposed unique ability to promote divergence with gene flow. Here, we ask how unique magic traits are, by exploring whether a tightly linked complex of a locus under divergent selection and a locus that acts as a mating cue can mimic a magic trait in its divergence. We find that these \u201cpseudomagic traits\u201d can be very effective in promoting divergence; with tight linkage they are essentially as effective as a magic trait and with loose linkage, and even no linkage, divergence can still be enhanced. Distinguishing between magic and pseudomagic traits in empirical cases may thus not be important when inferring their role in divergence. The ability of divergence in the mating trait to drive divergence in the ecological trait by lowering the effective migration rate, which occurs somewhat even without linkage, is particularly striking; magic traits are typically considered to have the other direction of causality. Our results thus suggest that divergence in a mating trait can at least modestly increase local adaption by allowing more ecological divergence, particularly with tighter linkage.",

      "abstractNote": "Although learned mate preferences are suspected to have important effects during speciation, theoretical models have largely neglected the effects on speciation and population divergence of within-generational learning, that is, learning based upon prior experience with potential mates. Here, we use population genetic models to address this deficit. Focusing on the situation of secondary contact between populations that still hybridize, we consider models of learning by females and by males under polygyny. We assess the effects of learning to prefer conspecifics from previous conspecific encounters, learning to avoid heterospecifics from previous heterospecific encounters, and learning to prefer familiar types. We examine the amount of population divergence that results from learning in these models. We also assess the effect of learning on the spread of an allele that strengthens assortative mating in both models. We find that learning can have counterintuitive, but logical and understandable effects that differ with the version of the model assessed. In general, population divergence is expected to increase most consistently when females learn to strengthen their preferences for conspecifics from previous encounters with conspecifics. Our results also suggest that within-generational learning will generally inhibit the spread of alleles strengthening assortative mating.",

      "abstractNote": "Decades of theoretical work on the evolution of adaptive prezygotic isolation have led to an interesting finding\u2014namely that stable partial reproductive isolation is a relatively common outcome. This conclusion is generally lost, however, in the desire to pinpoint when exactly speciation occurs. Here, we argue that the evolution of partial reproductive isolation is of great interest in its own right and matches empirical findings that ongoing hybridization is taxonomically widespread. We present the mechanisms by which partial reproductive isolation can be a stable evolutionary endpoint, concentrating on insights from theoretical studies. We focus not on cases in which hybridization results from constraints imposed by ongoing migration or mutation, but on the intriguing idea that partial reproductive isolation may instead be an adaptive optimum. We identify three general categories of selective mechanisms that can lead to partial reproductive isolation: context-dependent hybrid advantage, indirect selection due to the varying actions of sexual selection in different geographic contexts, and a balance of costs of choosiness with indirect selection for stronger mating preferences. By any of these mechanisms, stable partial reproductive isolation can potentially provide a robust evolutionary alternative to either complete speciation or population fusion.",

      "abstractNote": "Although reinforcement is ostensibly driven by selection against hybrids, there are often other components in empirical cases and theoretical models of reinforcement that may contribute to premating isolation. One of these components is local adaptation of a trait used in mate choice. I use several different comparisons to assess the roles that local adaptation and selection against hybrids may play in reinforcement models. Both numerical simulations of exact recursion equations and analytical weak selection approximations are employed. I find that selection against hybrids may play a small role in driving preference evolution in a reinforcement model where the mating cue is separate from loci causing hybrid incompatibilities. When females have preferences directly for purebreds of their own population, however, selection against hybrids can play a large role in premating isolation evolution. I present some situations in which this type of selection is likely to exist. This work also illustrates shortfalls of using a weak selection approach to address questions about reinforcement.",

      "abstractNote": "Theoretical and empirical research on the evolution of reproductive isolation have both indicated that the effects of sexual selection on speciation with gene flow are quite complex. As part of this special issue on the contributions of women to basic and applied evolutionary biology, I discuss my work on this question in the context of a broader assessment of the patterns of sexual selection that lead to, versus inhibit, the speciation process, as derived from theoretical research. In particular, I focus on how two factors, the geographic context of speciation and the mechanism leading to assortative mating, interact to alter the effect that sexual selection through mate choice has on speciation. I concentrate on two geographic contexts: sympatry and secondary contact between two geographically separated populations that are exchanging migrants and two mechanisms of assortative mating: phenotype matching and separate preferences and traits. I show that both of these factors must be considered for the effects of sexual selection on speciation to be inferred.",

      "abstractNote": "The evolution of assortative mating is a key component of the process of speciation with gene flow. Several recent theoretical studies have pointed out, however, that sexual selection which can result from assortative mating may cause it to plateau at an intermediate level; this is primarily owing to search costs of individuals with extreme phenotypes and to assortative preferences developed by individuals with intermediate phenotypes. I explore the limitations of assortative mating further by analysing a simple model in which these factors have been removed. Specifically, I use a haploid two-population model to ask whether the existence of assortative mating is sufficient to drive the further evolution of assortative mating. I find that a weakening in the effective strength of sexual selection with strong assortment leads to the existence of both a peak level of trait differentiation and the evolution of an intermediate level of assortative mating that will cause that peak. This result is robust to the inclusion of local adaptation and different genetic architecture of the trait. The results imply the existence of fundamental limits to the evolution of assortment via sexual selection in this situation, with which other factors, such as search costs, may interact.",

      "abstractNote": "Speciation with gene flow is greatly facilitated when traits subject to divergent selection also contribute to non-random mating. Such traits have been called \u2018magic traits\u2019, which could be interpreted to imply that they are rare, special, or unrealistic. Here, we question this assumption by illustrating that magic traits can be produced by a variety of mechanisms, including ones in which reproductive isolation arises as an automatic by-product of adaptive divergence. We also draw upon the theoretical literature to explore whether magic traits have a unique role in speciation or can be mimicked in their effects by physically linked trait-complexes. We conclude that magic traits are more frequent than previously perceived, but further work is needed to clarify their importance.",

      "abstractNote": "The occurrence of reinforcement is compared when premating isolation is caused by the spread of a gene causing females to prefer to mate with males carrying a population-specific trait (a \"preference\" model) and by a gene that causes females to prefer to mate with males that share their own trait phenotype (an \"assortative mating\" model). Both two-island models, which have symmetric gene flow, and continent-island models, which have one-way gene flow, are explored. Reinforcement is found to occur much more easily in a two-island assortative mating model than in any of the other three models. This is due primarily to the fact that in this model the assortative mating allele will automatically become genetically associated in each population with the trait allele that is favored by natural selection on that island. In contrast, natural selection on the trait both favors and opposes the evolution of premating isolation in the two-island preference model, depending on the particular population. These results imply that species recognition in the context of mating may evolve particularly easily when it targets cues that are favored by natural selection in each population. In the continent-island models, reinforcement is found to occur more often under the preference model than the assortative mating model, thus reversing the trend from the two-island models. Patterns of population subdivision may therefore play a role in determining what types of premating isolation may evolve.",

      "abstractNote": "Geographic ranges of communities of species evolve in response to environmental, ecological, and evolutionary forces. Understanding the effects of these forces on species' range dynamics is a major goal of spatial ecology. Previous mathematical models have jointly captured the dynamic changes in species' population distributions and the selective evolution of fitness-related phenotypic traits in the presence of an environmental gradient. These models inevitably include some unrealistic assumptions, and biologically reasonable ranges of values for their parameters are not easy to specify. As a result, simulations of the seminal models of this type can lead to markedly different conclusions about the behavior of such populations, including the possibility of maladaptation setting stable range boundaries. Here, we harmonize such results by developing and simulating a continuum model of range evolution in a community of species that interact competitively while diffusing over an environmental gradient. Our model extends existing models by incorporating both competition and freely changing intraspecific trait variance. Simulations of this model predict a spatial profile of species' trait variance that is consistent with experimental measurements available in the literature. Moreover, they reaffirm interspecific competition as an effective factor in limiting species' ranges, even when trait variance is not artificially constrained. These theoretical results can inform the design of, as yet rare, empirical studies to clarify the evolutionary causes of range stabilization.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding the role of natural selection in driving evolutionary change requires accurate estimates of the strength of selection acting at the genetic level in the wild. This is challenging to achieve but may be easier in the case of populations in migration-selection balance. When two populations are at equilibrium under migrationselection balance, there exist loci whose alleles are selected different ways in the two populations. Such loci can be identified from genome sequencing by their high values of FST. This raises the question of what is the strength of selection on locally-adaptive alleles. To answer this question we analyse a 1-locus 2-allele model of a population distributed between two niches. We show by simulation of selected cases that the outputs from finitepopulation models are essentially the same as those from deterministic infinite-population models. We then derive theory for the infinite-population model showing the dependence of selection coefficients on equilibrium allele frequencies, migration rates, dominance and relative population sizes in the two niches. An Excel spreadsheet is provided for the calculation of selection coefficients and their approximate standard errors from observed values of population parameters. We illustrate our results with a worked example, with graphs showing the dependence of selection coefficients on equilibrium allele frequencies, and graphs showing how FST depends on the selection coefficients acting on the alleles at a locus. Given the extent of recent progress in ecological genomics, we hope our methods may help those studying migration-selection balance to quantify the advantages conferred by adaptive genes.",

      "title": "Sexual imprinting leads to speciation in locally adapted populations",
      "abstractNote": "Sexual imprinting is widespread in birds and other species but its existence requires explanation. Our results suggest that sexual imprinting leads to speciation in locally-adapted populations if a neutral mating cue-e.g., novel plumage coloration-arises through mutation. Importantly, the mating cue locus is not linked to adaptation loci. Local adaptation is a necessary precursor to speciation and occurs when evolution results in stable genetic polymorphisms with one allele predominating in some areas while others predominate elsewhere. Here we use a deterministic two-niche population genetic model to map the set of migration and selection rates for which polymorphic evolutionary outcomes, i.e., local adaptations, can occur. Approximate equations for the boundaries of the set of polymorphic evolutionary outcomes were derived by Bulmer (American Naturalist, 106, 254, 1972), but our results, obtained by deterministic simulation of the evolutionary process, show that one of Bulmer's equations is inaccurate except when the level of dominance is 0.5, and fails if one of the alleles is dominant. Having an accurate map of the set of migration and selection rates for which polymorphic evolutionary outcomes can occur, we then show using the model of Sibly et al. (Ecology and Evolution, 9, 13506, 2019) that local adaptation in all analyzed cases leads to speciation if a new neutral mating cue arises by mutation. We finish by considering how genome sequencing makes possible testing our model and its predictions.",

      "title": "The degree of spatial variation relative to temporal variation influences evolution of dispersal",
      "abstractNote": "In the face of ongoing global climate and land use change, organisms have multiple possibilities to cope with the modification of their environment. The two main possibilities are to either adapt locally or disperse to a more suitable habitat. The evolution of both local adaptation and dispersal interacts and can be influenced by the spatial and temporal variation (of e.g. temperature or precipitation). In an individual based model (IBM), we explore evolution of phenotypes in landscapes with varying degree of spatial relative to global temporal variation in order to examine its influence on the evolution of dispersal, niche optimum and niche width. The relationship between temporal and spatial variation did neither influence the evolution of local adaptation in the niche optimum nor of niche widths. Dispersal probability is highly influenced by the spatio-temporal relationship: with increasing spatial variation, dispersal probability decreases. Additionally, the shape of the distribution of the trait values over patch attributes switches from hump- to U-shaped. At low spatial variance more individuals emigrate from average habitats, at high spatial variance more from extreme habitats. The comparatively high dispersal probability in extreme patches of landscapes with a high spatial variation can be explained by evolutionary succession of two kinds of adaptive response. Early in the simulations, extreme patches in landscapes with a high spatial variability act as sink habitats, where population persistence depends on highly dispersive individuals with a wide niche. With ongoing evolution, local adaptation of the remaining individuals takes over, but simultaneously a possible bet-hedging strategy promotes higher dispersal probabilities in those habitats. Here, in generations that experience extreme shifts from the temporal mean of the patch attribute, the expected fitness becomes higher for dispersing individuals than for philopatric individuals. This means that under certain circumstances, both local adaptation and high dispersal probability can be selected for for coping with the projected environmental changes in the future.",

      "abstractNote": "The spread of genes and individuals through space in populations is relevant in many biological contexts. I study, via systems of reaction-diffusion equations, the spatial spread of advantageous alleles through structured populations. The results show that the temporally asymptotic rate of spread of an advantageous allele, a kind of invasion speed, can be approximated for a class of linear partial differential equations via a relatively simple formula, c = 2rootr (D) over bar, that is reminiscent of a classic formula attributed to R. A. Fisher. The parameters r and (D) over bar represent an asymptotic growth rate and an average diffusion rate, respectively, and can be interpreted in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors that depend on the population's demographic structure. The results can be applied, under certain conditions, to a wide class of nonlinear partial differential equations that are relevant to a variety of ecological and evolutionary scenarios in population biology. I illustrate the approach for computing invasion speed with three examples that allow for heterogeneous dispersal rates among different classes of individuals within model populations.",

      "abstractNote": "There is abundant geographic variation in both morphology and gene frequency in most species. The extent of geographic variation results from a balance of forces tending to produce local genetic differentiation and forces tending to produce genetic homogeneity. Mutation, genetic drift due to finite population size, and natural selection favoring adaptations to local environmental conditions will all lead to the genetic differentiation of local populations, and the movement of gametes, individuals, and even entire populations--collectively called gene flow--will oppose that differentiation. Gene flow may either constrain evolution by preventing adaptation to local conditions or promote evolution by spreading new genes and combinations of genes throughout a species' range. Several methods are available for estimating the amount of gene flow. Direct methods monitor ongoing gene flow, and indirect methods use spatial distributions of gene frequencies to infer past gene flow. Applications of these methods show that species differ widely in the gene flow that they experience. Of particular interest are those species for which direct methods indicate little current gene flow but indirect methods indicate much higher levels of gene flow in the recent past. Such species probably have undergone large-scale demographic changes relatively frequently.",

Different patterns of spatial variation in selective pressures are considered, including a step change in the environment, a \"pocket\" in the environment and a periodically varying environment. Also, the problem of the effect of a geographic barrier to dispersal is analyzed. The results are: (1) there is a characteristic length scale of variation of gene frequencies, (see PDF). The population cannot respond to changes in environmental conditions which occur over a distance less than the characteristic length. The result does not depend either on the pattern of variation in selective pressures or on the exact shape of the dispersal function. (2) The reduction in the fitness of the heterozygote causes a cline in gene frequencies to become steeper. (3) A geographic barrier to dispersal causes a drastic change in the gene frequencies at the barrier only when almost all of the individuals trying to cross the barrier are stopped.",

      "abstractNote": "It is shown that in a heterogeneous environment divided into two \"niches,\" a stable polymorphism can exist between two alleles each conferring a selective advantage in one of the niches, even if adults form a single random-mating population, provided: (1) the population size is separately regulated in the two niches, and (2) the selective advantages are large. The conditions to be satisfied are given; it is difficult to say how often they will be satisfied. A stable polymorphism is favored if females tend to lay eggs in the niche in which they were themselves raised. Four genetic mechanisms--habitat selection, pleiotropic genes, modifying genes, and assortative mating genes--which could cause mating isolation are considered. It is concluded that stable polymorphism could be the first stage in sympatric speciation. The relevance of these mechanisms in allopatric speciation is also discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation arises as a result of selection by the local environment favoring phenotypes that enhance fitness. Geographic patterns of phenotypic variation are in part due to this selective process. Classically, the genetic basis of those phenotypes has been studied in plant populations using a quantitative genetic approach in which plants from different source populations are grown in common environments, in reciprocal transplant experiments, or in studies across a wide geographic and environmentally heterogeneous area. Limitations of these approaches to understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation can now be addressed with next generation sequencing, gene expression profiles, and epigenetic analysis. In this paper, I summarize contemporary genomic research on local adaptation by comparing findings from the Arabidopsis annual plant model system with long-lived tree species in four kinds of local adaptation studies: 1) genomic studies of transplant experiments; 2) landscape genomic studies; 3) gene expression studies; 4) epigenetic studies of local adaptation. Although the basic study designs of common garden, reciprocal transplants, and geographic variation have remained constant, the inclusion of contemporary genomic approaches has provided substantive advances in our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of local adaptation, including the impact of climate, the identification of candidate genes involved in genotype-by-environment interactions, and evidence for the potential role of epigenetic modification. Despite these advances, new questions are arising and key areas for future research include more exploration of gene networks in response to biotic and abiotic stressors and improved statistical tools for traits with polygenic inheritance.",

      "abstractNote": "On the basis of single-locus models, spatial heterogeneity of the environment coupled with strong population regulation within each habitat (soft selection) is considered an important mechanism maintaining genetic variation. We studied the capacity of soft selection to maintain polygenic variation for a trait determined by several additive loci, selected in opposite directions in two habitats connected by dispersal. We found three main types of stable equilibria. Extreme equilibria are characterized by extreme specialization to one habitat and loss of polymorphism. They are analogous to monomorphic equilibria in singe-locus models and are favored by similar factors: high dispersal, weak selection, and low marginal average fitness of intermediate genotypes. At the remaining two types of equilibria the population mean is intermediate but variance is very different. At fully polymorphic equilibria all loci are polymorphic, whereas at low-variance equilibria at most one locus remains polymorphic. For most parameters only one type of equilibrium is stable; the transition between the domains of fully polymorphic and low-variance equilibria is typically sharp. Low-variance equilibria are favored by high marginal average fitness of intermediate genotypes, in contrast to single-locus models, in which marginal overdominance is particularly favorable for maintenance of polymorphism. The capacity of soft selection to maintain polygenic variation is thus more limited than extrapolation from single-locus models would suggest, in particular if dispersal is high and selection weak. This is because in a polygenic model, variance can evolve independently of the mean, whereas in the single-locus two-allele case, selection for an intermediate mean automatically leads to maintenance of polymorphism.",

      "abstractNote": "Environmental heterogeneity is regarded as one of the most important factors governing species richness gradients. An increase in available niche space, provision of refuges and opportunities for isolation and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance species coexistence, persistence and diversification. However, the extent and generality of positive heterogeneity\u2013richness relationships are still debated. Apart from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and hump-shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta-analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and direction of the relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity\u2013richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity\u2013richness studies. We provide the first quantitative support for the generality of positive heterogeneity\u2013richness relationships across heterogeneity components, habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents, and identify specific needs for future comparative heterogeneity\u2013richness research.",

These thermal sensitivities create the potential for climate change to have a marked impact on disease transmission. To date, most research considering impacts of climate change on vector-borne diseases assumes that all populations of a given parasite or vector species respond similarly to temperature, regardless of their source population. This may be an inappropriate assumption because spatial variation in selective pressures such as temperature can lead to local adaptation. We examine evidence for local adaptation in disease vectors and present conceptual models for understanding how local adaptation might modulate the effects of both short- and long-term changes in climate.",

      "abstractNote": "Two models of selection in a fine-grained environment are developed. In the first model the viability of an individual in each part of its life depends on in which environment it is located. In the second model the fitness of an individual is a function of the amount of a product accumulated during its life. The amount of the product accumulated during each part of its life depends on in which environment it is. For both models it is shown that there must be a heterozygotic advantage in order for polymorphism to be maintained. However, under some circumstances a heterozygotic advantage can result from selection in opposite directions in two environments. The applicability of adaptive functions and fitness sets to selection in fine- and coarse-grained environments is also discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "We describe a model for the evolutionary consequences of plasticity in an environmentally heterogeneous metapopulation in which specialists for each of two alternative environments and one plastic type are initially present. The model is similar to that proposed by Moran (1992) but extends her work to two sites. We show that with migration between sites the plastic type is favored over local specialists across a broad range of parameter space. The plastic type may dominate or be fixed even in an environmentally uniform site, and even if the plasticity has imperfect accuracy or bears some cost such that a local specialist has higher fitness in that site, as long as there is some migration between sites with different distributions of environmental states. These results suggest that differences among taxa in dispersal and hence realized migration rates may play a heretofore unrecognized role in their patterns of adaptive population differentiation. Migration relaxes the thresholds for both environmental heterogeneity and accuracy of plastic response above which plasticity is favored. Furthermore, small changes in response accuracy can dramatically and abruptly alter the evolutionary outcome in the metapopulation. A fitness cost to plasticity will substantially reduce the range of conditions in which the plastic type will prevail only if the cost is both large and global rather than environment specific.",

      "title": "Sex differences in local adaptation: what can we learn from reciprocal transplant experiments?",
      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation is of fundamental interest to evolutionary biologists. Traditionally, local adaptation has been studied using reciprocal transplant experiments to quantify fitness differences between residents and immigrants in pairwise transplants between study populations. Previous studies have detected local adaptation in some cases, but others have shown lack of adaptation or even maladaptation. Recently, the importance of different fitness components, such as survival and fecundity, to local adaptation have been emphasized. Here, we address another neglected aspect in studies of local adaptation: sex differences. Given the ubiquity of sexual dimorphism in life histories and phenotypic traits, this neglect is surprising, but may be partly explained by differences in research traditions and terminology in the fields of local adaptation and sexual selection. Studies that investigate differences in mating success between resident and immigrants across populations tend to be framed in terms of reproductive and behavioural isolation, rather than local adaptation. We briefly review the published literature that bridges these areas and suggest that reciprocal transplant experiments could benefit from quantifying both male and female fitness components. Such a more integrative research approach could clarify the role of sex differences in the evolution of local adaptations.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue \u2018Linking local adaptation with the evolution of sex differences'.",

      "abstractNote": "This article analyzes the conditions for local adaptation in a metapopulation with infinitely many islands under a model of hard selection, where population size depends on local fitness. Each island belongs to one of two distinct ecological niches or habitats. Fitness is influenced by an additive trait which is under habitat-dependent directional selection. Our analysis is based on the diffusion approximation and accounts for both genetic drift and demographic stochasticity. By neglecting linkage disequilibria, it yields the joint distribution of allele frequencies and population size on each island. We find that under hard selection, the conditions for local adaptation in a rare habitat are more restrictive for more polygenic traits: even moderate migration load per locus at very many loci is sufficient for population sizes to decline. This further reduces the efficacy of selection at individual loci due to increased drift and because smaller populations are more prone to swamping due to migration, causing a positive feedback between increasing maladaptation and declining population sizes. Our analysis also highlights the importance of demographic stochasticity, which exacerbates the decline in numbers of maladapted populations, leading to population collapse in the rare habitat at significantly lower migration than predicted by deterministic arguments.",

      "abstractNote": "Studies of gene\u2013environment (G\u00d7E) interactions can be useful for investigating biological pathways, and can reveal genes that act only in particular environments or exposures that are hazardous only to genetically susceptible individuals. Such knowledge can be used for setting environmental safety standards, understanding heterogeneity in genetic associations across populations, predicting the risks and changes to an individual that might result from changes in modifiable risk factors, and choosing the best treatment based on a patient's genotype.Basic epidemiological cohort or case\u2013control designs can be used for studying G\u00d7E interactions, but more powerful alternatives include case-only, two-phase case\u2013control and counter-matched designs. Case-only substudies within clinical trials are attractive for studying genetic modifiers of treatment response because genotype and treatment can be assumed to be independent through randomization.Various exploratory and hypothesis-driven approaches are available for examining the joint effects of multiple genes and exposures in a common pathway. Hierarchical models provide a way to incorporate external knowledge about the pathway into the analysis of complex interactions in the study data.Two-step analyses can be used in genome-wide association studies to target a subset of promising interactions and improve the power for testing them in the same data set using an independent test. New methods are being developed that use pathway information to guide the search for novel genes and interactions or that mine agnostic genome scans for novel pathways.Comprehensive ontologies that incorporate environmental and toxicological information into genomic and pathway databases will be useful for informing future analyses of complex G\u00d7E interactions in both pathway-driven and genome-wide association scans.Emerging areas include understanding how the environment influences gene expression through epigenetics, somatic mutations and other mechanisms, and understanding the roles of these effects in disease causation. Various types of biomarkers and high-volume metabolomics methods can be incorporated as intermediate variables in pathway-based analysis methods.",

      "title": "The conflict between adaptation and dispersal for maintaining biodiversity in changing environments",
      "abstractNote": "Dispersal and adaptation both allow species to persist in changing environments. Yet, we have limited understanding of how these processes interact to affect species persistence, especially in diverse communities where biotic interactions greatly complicate responses to environmental change. Here we use a stochastic metacommunity model to demonstrate how dispersal and adaptation to environmental change independently and interactively contribute to biodiversity maintenance. Dispersal provides spatial insurance, whereby species persist on the landscape by shifting their distributions to track favorable conditions. In contrast, adaptation allows species to persist by allowing for evolutionary rescue. But, when species both adapt and disperse, dispersal and adaptation do not combine positively to affect biodiversity maintenance, even if they do increase the persistence of individual species. This occurs because faster adapting species evolve to hold onto their initial ranges (i.e., monopolization effects), thus impeding slower adapting species from shifting their ranges and thereby causing extinctions. Importantly, these differences in adaptation speed emerge as the result of competition, which alters population sizes and colonization success. By demonstrating how dispersal and adaptation each independently and interactively contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity, we provide a framework that links the theories of spatial insurance, evolutionary rescue, and monopolization. This highlights the expectation that the maintenance of biodiversity in changing environments depends jointly on rates of dispersal and adaptation, and, critically, the interaction between these processes.",

      "abstractNote": "Adaptation often proceeds from standing variation, and natural selection acting on pairs of populations is a quantitative continuum ranging from parallel to divergent. Yet, it is unclear how the extent of parallel genetic evolution during adaptation from standing variation is affected by the difference in the direction of selection between populations. Nor is it clear whether the availability of standing variation for adaptation affects progress toward speciation in a manner that depends on the difference in the direction of selection. We conducted a theoretical study investigating these questions and have two primary findings. First, the extent of parallel genetic evolution between two populations rapidly declines as selection changes from fully parallel toward divergent, and this decline is steeper in organisms with more traits (i.e., greater dimensionality). This rapid decline happens because small differences in the direction of selection greatly reduce the fraction of alleles that are beneficial in both populations. For example, populations adapting to optima separated by an angle of 33\u00b0 might have only 50% of potentially beneficial alleles in common. Second, relative to when adaptation is from only new mutation, adaptation from standing variation improves hybrid fitness under parallel selection and reduces hybrid fitness under divergent selection. Under parallel selection, genetic parallelism from standing variation reduces the phenotypic segregation variance in hybrids, thereby increasing mean fitness in the parental environment. Under divergent selection, larger pleiotropic effects of alleles fixed from standing variation cause maladaptive transgressive phenotypes when combined in hybrids. Adaptation from standing genetic variation therefore slows progress toward speciation under parallel selection and facilitates progress toward speciation under divergent selection.",

      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation shapes species diversity, can be a stepping stone to ecological speciation, and can facilitate species range expansion. Population genetic analyses, which complement organismal approaches in advancing our understanding of local adaptation, have become widespread in recent years. We focus here on using population genetics to address some key questions in local adaptation: what traits are involved? What environmental variables are the most important? Does local adaptation target the same genes in related species? Do loci responsible for local adaptation exhibit trade-offs across environments? After discussing these questions we highlight important limitations to population genetic analyses including challenges with obtaining high-quality data, deciding which loci are targets of selection, and limits to identifying the genetic basis of local adaptation.",

      "abstractNote": "Gene flow is a fundamental evolutionary force in adaptation that is especially important to understand as humans are rapidly changing both the natural environment and natural levels of gene flow. Theory proposes a multifaceted role for gene flow in adaptation, but it focuses mainly on the disruptive effect that gene flow has on adaptation when selection is not strong enough to prevent the loss of locally adapted alleles. The role of gene flow in adaptation is now better understood due to the recent development of both genomic models of adaptive evolution and genomic techniques, which both point to the importance of genetic architecture in the origin and maintenance of adaptation with gene flow. In this review, we discuss three main topics on the genomics of adaptation with gene flow. First, we investigate selection on migration and gene flow. Second, we discuss the three potential sources of adaptive variation in relation to the role of gene flow in the origin of adaptation. Third, we explain how local adaptation is maintained despite gene flow: we provide a synthesis of recent genomic models of adaptation, discuss the genomic mechanisms and review empirical studies on the genomics of adaptation with gene flow. Despite predictions on the disruptive effect of gene flow in adaptation, an increasing number of studies show that gene flow can promote adaptation, that local adaptations can be maintained despite high gene flow, and that genetic architecture plays a fundamental role in the origin and maintenance of local adaptation with gene flow.",

      "abstractNote": "We study the establishment probabilities of locally adapted mutations using a multi-type branching process framework. We find a surprisingly simple and intuitive analytical approximation for the establishment probabilities in a symmetric two-deme model under the assumption of weak (positive) selection. This is the first analytical closed-form approximation for arbitrary migration rate to appear in the literature. We find that the establishment probability lies between the weak and the strong migration limits if we condition the origin of the mutation to the deme where it is advantageous. This is not the case when we condition the mutation to first occur in a deme where it is disadvantageous. In this case we find that an intermediate migration rate maximizes the probability of establishment. We extend our results to the cases of multiple demes, two demes with asymmetric rates of gene flow, and asymmetric carrying capacities. The latter case allows us to illustrate how density regulation can affect establishment probabilities. Finally, we use our results to investigate the role of gene flow on the rate of local adaptation and identify cases in which intermediate amounts of gene flow facilitate the rate of local adaptation as compared to two populations without gene flow.",

      "abstractNote": "A model of the joint dynamics of change in population size N and evolution in a quantitative trait z, as a result of a general form of density dependence, local stabilizing selection, and immigration of individuals deviating from the local optimum, is analyzed. For weak selection and migration, a reduction in total equilibrium population size below the initial level without immigration, K, is shown to occur if the immigrants deviates more than square root of 8 = 2.83 genetic standard deviations from the optimum and if the rate of migration m is sufficiently large relative to the strength of stabilizing selection s. For the Lotka-Volterra form of density dependence, two additional equilibria are shown to exist below K, provided that the strength of selection is large relative to the strength of density dependence. Reintroduction of an initially extinct population is possible if the immigrants are not too maladapted and if the genetic variance is sufficiently large. For a simplified version of the model corresponding to competition between similar species or different haplotypes, the equilibrium population size is always exactly at K if m < Ksz1(2) and is above K otherwise, which shows the importance of including recombination in the model.",

      "abstractNote": "The evolution of a quantitative trait subject to stabilizing selection and immigration, with the \nimmigrants deviating from the local optimum, is considered under a number of different models of \nthe underlying genetic basis of the trait. By comparing exact predictions under the infinitesimal \nmodel obtained using numerical methods with predictions of a simplified approximate model based \non ignoring linkage disequilibrium, the increase in the expressed genetic variance as a result of \nlinkage disequilibrium generated by migration is shown to be relatively small and negligible, \nprovided that the genetic variance relative to the squared deviation of immigrants from the local \noptimum is sufficiently large or selection and migration is sufficiently weak. Deviation from \nnormality is shown to be less important by comparing predictions of the infinitesimal model with a \nmodel presupposing normality. For a more realistic symmetric model, involving a finite number of \nloci only, no linkage and equal effects and frequencies across loci, additional changes in the genetic \nvariance arise as a result of changes in underlying allele frequencies. Again, provided that the \ngenetic variance relative to the squared deviation of the immigrants from the local optimum is \nsmall, the difference between the predictions of infinitesimal and the symmetric model are small \nunless the number of loci is very small. However, if the genetic variance relative to the squared \ndeviation of the immigrants from the local optimum is large, or if selection and migration are \nstrong, both linkage disequilibrium and changes in the genetic variance as a result of changes in \nunderlying allele frequencies become important.",

      "title": "Liking the good guys: amplifying local adaptation via the evolution of condition-dependent mate choice",
      "abstractNote": "Local adaptation can be strengthened through a diversity of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between contrasting environments. Recent work revealed that mate choice could enhance local adaptation when females preferentially mate with locally adapted males and that such female preferences readily evolve, but the opposing effects of recombination, migration and costs of female preferences remain relatively unexplored. To investigate these effects, we develop a two-patch model with two genes, one influencing an ecological trait and one influencing female preferences, where both male signals and female preferences are allowed to depend on the match between an individual's ecological trait and the local environment (condition). Because trait variation is limited when migration is rare and the benefits of preferential mating are short-lived when migration is frequent, we find that female preferences for males in high condition spread most rapidly with intermediate levels of migration. Surprisingly, we find that preferences for locally adapted males spread fastest with higher recombination rates, which contrasts with earlier studies. This is because a stronger preference allele for locally adapted males can only get uncoupled from maladapted ecological alleles following migration through recombination. The effects of migration and recombination depend strongly on the condition of the males being chosen by females, but only weakly on the condition of the females doing the choosing, except when it comes to the costs of preference. Although costs always impede the spread of female preferences for locally adapted males, the impact is substantially lessened if costs are borne primarily by females in poor condition. The abundance of empirical examples of condition-dependent mate choice combined with our theoretical results suggests that the evolution of mate choice could commonly facilitate local adaptation in nature.",

      "abstractNote": "Seed size, dormancy, and dispersal share three population-dynamic functions in temporally and spatially varying environments: risk reduction or bet hedging, escape from crowding, and escape from sib competition. Here we developed a model to explore the ways they may interact to reduce risk. We have shown that the risk-reducing properties of these three seed traits evolve only in response to global temporal variance. Thus, to understand how selection impinges on the seed traits, creating fitness interactions, we must understand the factors contributing to global temporal variance and how they are mitigated by the various seed traits. Since the traits interact to reduce variance, arbitrarily fixing any one trait at different values alters the fitness-maximizing values of the others, resulting in trade-offs among traits. We explore how changes in the number of independent environmental patches, the probability of favorable conditions, the radius of dispersal, and spatial and temporal autocorrelation of environmental conditions alter selection on the interacting syndrome of seed traits. We discuss the implications of these fitness interactions for our understanding of each of the seed traits in isolation, as well as for our understanding of seeds as reproductive structures integrating coadapted functions.",

      "title": "Genotype-Environment Interaction and the Evolution of Phenotypic Plasticity",
      "abstractNote": "Studies of spatial variation in the environment have primarily focused on how genetic variation can be maintained. Many one-locus genetic models have addressed this issue, but, for several reasons, these models are not directly applicable to quantitative (polygenic) traits. One reason is that for continuously varying characters, the evolution of the mean phenotype expressed in different environments (the norm of reaction) is also of interest. Our quantitative genetic models describe the evolution of phenotypic response to the environment, also known as phenotypic plasticity (Gause, 1947), and illustrate how the norm of reaction (Schmalhausen, 1949) can be shaped by selection. These models utilize the statistical relationship which exists between genotype-environment interaction and genetic correlation to describe evolution of the mean phenotype under soft and hard selection in coarse-grained environments. Just as genetic correlations among characters within a single environment can constrain the response to simultaneous selection, so can a genetic correlation between states of a character which are expressed in two environments. Unless the genetic correlation across environments is \u00b1 1, polygenic variation is exhausted, or there is a cost to plasticity, panmictic populations under a bivariate fitness function will eventually attain the optimum mean phenotype for a given character in each environment. However, very high positive or negative correlations can substantially slow the rate of evolution and may produce temporary maladaptation in one environment before the optimum joint phenotype is finally attained. Evolutionary trajectories under hard and soft selection can differ: in hard selection, the environments with the highest initial mean fitness contribute most individuals to the mating pool. In both hard and soft selection, evolution toward the optimum in a rare environment is much slower than it is in a common one. A subdivided population model reveals that migration restriction can facilitate local adaptation. However, unless there is no migration or one of the special cases discussed for panmictic populations holds, no geographical variation in the norm of reaction will be maintained at equilibrium. Implications of these results for the interpretation of spatial patterns of phenotypic variation in natural populations are discussed.",

Here, we advocate for research that broadens our understanding of local adaptation beyond pattern and towards process. We discuss how studies of local adaptation can be designed to address two unresolved questions in evolutionary ecology: Does local adaptation result from fitness trade-offs at individual loci across habitats? How do agents of selection interact to generate local adaptation to discrete contrasting habitats types and continuous environmental gradients? To inform future investigations of the genetic basis of local adaptation, we conducted a literature review of studies that mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fitness in native field environments using reciprocal transplant experiments with hybrid mapping populations or Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) panels. We then reviewed the literature for field experiments that disentangle the contributions of various agents of selection to local adaptation. For each question, we suggest future lines of inquiry and discuss implications for climate change and agriculture research. (i) Studies in the native habitats of five biological systems revealed that local adaptation is more often caused by conditional neutrality than genetic trade-offs at the level of the QTL. We consider the ramifications of this result and discuss knowledge gaps in our current understanding of the genetic basis of local adaptation. (ii) We uncovered only five studies that identified the agents of selection that contribute to local adaptation, and nearly all were conducted in discrete habitats rather than across the continuous environmental gradients that many species inhabit. We introduce a novel experimental framework for illuminating the processes underlying local adaptation. A holistic view of local adaptation is critical for predicting the responses of organisms to climate change, enhancing conservation efforts, and developing strategies to improve crop resilience to environmental stress. Experiments that manipulate agents of selection in native field environments using pedigreed populations or GWAS panels offer unique opportunities for detecting the genetic and environmental mechanisms that generate local adaptation.",

We introduce a novel experimental framework for illuminating the processes underlying local adaptation.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    A holistic view of local adaptation is critical for predicting the responses of organisms to climate change, enhancing conservation efforts, and developing strategies to improve crop resilience to environmental stress.

      "abstractNote": "Divergent selection across the landscape can favor the evolution of local adaptation in populations experiencing contrasting conditions. Local adaptation is widely observed in a diversity of taxa, yet we have a surprisingly limited understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to it. For instance, few have experimentally confirmed the biotic and abiotic variables that promote local adaptation, and fewer yet have identified the phenotypic targets of selection that mediate local adaptation. Here, we highlight critical gaps in our understanding of the process of local adaptation and discuss insights emerging from in-depth investigations of the agents of selection that drive local adaptation, the phenotypes they target, and the genetic basis of these phenotypes. We review historical and contemporary methods for assessing local adaptation, explore whether local adaptation manifests differently across life history, and evaluate constraints on local adaptation.",

Unlike the estimators in general use, the formulae do not make assumptions concerning numbers of populations, sample sizes, or heterozygote frequencies. As such, they are suited to small data sets and will aid the comparisons of results of different investigators. A simple weighting procedure is suggested for combining information over alleles and loci, and sample variances may be estimated by a jackknife procedure.",

      "abstractNote": "Climate change is an escalating threat facing populations around the globe, necessitating a robust understanding of the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms dictating population responses. However, populations respond to climate change not in isolation but rather in the context of their existing ranges. In particular, spatial population structure within a range (e.g., trait clines, starkness of range edges, etc.) likely interacts with other ecological and evolutionary processes during climate-induced range shifts. Here, we use an individual-based model to explore the interacting roles of several such factors in range shift dynamics. We show that increased spatial population structure (driven primarily by a steeper environmental gradient) severely increases a population\u2019s extinction risk. Further, we show that while evolution of heightened dispersal during range shifts can aid populations in tracking changing conditions, it can also interact negatively with adaptation to the environmental gradient, leading to reduced fitness and contributing to the increased extinction risk observed in populations structured along steep environmental gradients. Our results demonstrate that the effect of dispersal evolution on range-shifting populations is dependent on environmental context and that spatial population structure can substantially increase extinction risk in range shifts.",

      "title": "Adaptive speciation theory: a conceptual review",
      "abstractNote": "Speciation\u2014the origin of new species\u2014is the source of the diversity of life. A theory of speciation is essential to link poorly understood macro-evolutionary processes, such as the origin of biodiversity and adaptive radiation, to well understood micro-evolutionary processes, such as allele frequency change due to natural or sexual selection. An important question is whether, and to what extent, the process of speciation is \u2018adaptive\u2019, i.e., driven by natural and/or sexual selection. Here, we discuss two main modelling approaches in adaptive speciation theory. Ecological models of speciation focus on the evolution of ecological differentiation through divergent natural selection. These models can explain the stable coexistence of the resulting daughter species in the face of interspecific competition, but they are often vague about the evolution of reproductive isolation. Most sexual selection models of speciation focus on the diversification of mating strategies through divergent sexual selection. These models can explain the evolution of prezygotic reproductive isolation, but they are typically vague on questions like ecological coexistence. By means of an integrated model, incorporating both ecological interactions and sexual selection, we demonstrate that disruptive selection on both ecological and mating strategies is necessary, but not sufficient, for speciation to occur. To achieve speciation, mating must at least partly reflect ecological characteristics. The interaction of natural and sexual selection is also pivotal in a model where sexual selection facilitates ecological speciation even in the absence of diverging female preferences. In view of these results, it is counterproductive to consider ecological and sexual selection models as contrasting and incompatible views on speciation, one being dominant over the other. Instead, an integrative perspective is needed to achieve a thorough and coherent understanding of adaptive speciation.",

      "abstractNote": "Divergent selection applied to one or more traits drives local adaptation and may lead to ecological speciation. Divergent selection on many traits might be termed \"multidimensional\" divergent selection. There is a commonly held view that multidimensional divergent selection is likely to promote local adaptation and speciation to a greater extent than unidimensional divergent selection. We disentangle the core concepts underlying dimensionality as a property of the environment, phenotypes, and genome. In particular, we identify a need to separate the overall strength of selection and the number of loci affected from dimensionality per se, and to distinguish divergence dimensionality from dimensionality of stabilizing selection. We then critically scrutinize this commonly held view that multidimensional selection promotes speciation, re-examining the evidence base from theory, experiments, and nature. We conclude that the evidence base is currently weak and generally suffers from confounding of possible causal effects. Finally, we propose several mechanisms by which multidimensional divergent selection and related processes might influence divergence, both as a driver and as a barrier.",

      "abstractNote": "The study of local adaptation has been very important for the development of evolutionary biology broadly. This tradition continues; through new developments in diverse areas, we have more insight into the nature of the ongoing evolutionary process in a heterogeneous spatial context than ever before. This special issue follows from the 2014 Vice-Presidential Symposium of the American Society of Naturalists, bringing together outstanding researchers doing theoretical and empirical work, laboratory work, and fieldwork, with new data and new nodes of analysis. Through study of local adaptation, we learn about a tremendous source of biodiversity, both genetic and phenotypic, within and among species.",

      "abstractNote": "We investigate the probability of fixation of a new mutation arising in a metapopulation that ranges over a heterogeneous selective environment. Using simulations, we test the performance of several approximations of this probability, including a new analytical approximation based on separation of the timescales of selection and migration. We extend all approximations to multideme metapopulations with arbitrary population structure. Our simulations show that no single approximation produces accurate predictions of fixation probabilities for all cases of potential interest. At the limits of low and high migration, previously published approximations are found to be highly accurate. The new separation-of-timescales approach provides the best approximations for intermediate rates of migration among habitats, provided selection is not too intense. For nonzero migration and relatively strong selection, all approximations perform poorly. However, the probability of fixation is bounded above and below by the approximations based on low and high migration limits. Surprisingly, in our simulations with symmetric migration, heterogeneous selection in a metapopulation never decreased\u2014and sometimes substantially increased\u2014the probability of fixation of a new allele compared to metapopulations experiencing homogeneous selection with the same mean selection intensity.",

      "abstractNote": "Verbal explanations for the evolution of migration and dispersal often invoke inbreeding depression as an important force. Experimental work on plant populations indicates that while inbreeding depression may favor increased migration rates, adaptation to local environments may reduce the advantage to migrants. We formalize and test this hypothesis using a two-locus genetic model that incorporates lowered fitness in offspring produced by self-fertilization, and habitat differentiation. We also use the model to address questions about the general theory of genetic modifiers and the modifier reduction principle. We find that even under conditions when migration would increase the mean fitness of a population, migration may not be favored. This result is due to the associations that develop between genotypes at a locus subject to overdominant selection and at a neutral locus controlling the migration rate. Thus, it appears that, in this model, the forces of local adaptation, which favor a reduction in the migration rate, overwhelm those of inbreeding depression, which may favor dispersal.",

      "abstractNote": "Most natural populations are affected by seasonal changes in temperature, rainfall, or resource availability. Seasonally fluctuating selection could potentially make a large contribution to maintaining genetic polymorphism in populations. However, previous theory suggests that the conditions for multilocus polymorphism are restrictive. Here, we explore a more general class of models with multilocus seasonally fluctuating selection in diploids. In these models, the multilocus genotype is mapped to fitness in two steps. The first mapping is additive across loci and accounts for the relative contributions of heterozygous and homozygous loci\u2014that is, dominance. The second step uses a nonlinear fitness function to account for the strength of selection and epistasis. Using mathematical analysis and individual-based simulations, we show that stable polymorphism at many loci is possible if currently favored alleles are sufficiently dominant. This general mechanism, which we call \u201csegregation lift,\u201d requires seasonal changes in dominance, a phenomenon that may arise naturally in situations with antagonistic pleiotropy and seasonal changes in the relative importance of traits for fitness. Segregation lift works best under diminishing-returns epistasis, is not affected by problems of genetic load, and is robust to differences in parameters across loci and seasons. Under segregation lift, loci can exhibit conspicuous seasonal allele-frequency fluctuations, but often fluctuations may be small and hard to detect. An important direction for future work is to formally test for segregation lift in empirical data and to quantify its contribution to maintaining genetic variation in natural populations.",

      "abstractNote": "As climate change threatens species' persistence, predicting the potential for species to adapt to rapidly changing environments is imperative for the development of effective conservation strategies. Eco-evolutionary individual-based models (IBMs) can be useful tools for achieving this objective. We performed a literature review to identify studies that apply these tools in marine systems. Our survey suggested that this is an emerging area of research fuelled in part by developments in modelling frameworks that allow simulation of increasingly complex ecological, genetic and demographic processes. The studies we identified illustrate the promise of this approach and advance our understanding of the capacity for adaptation to outpace climate change. These studies also identify limitations of current models and opportunities for further development. We discuss three main topics that emerged across studies: (i) effects of genetic architecture and non-genetic responses on adaptive potential; (ii) capacity for gene flow to facilitate rapid adaptation; and (iii) impacts of multiple stressors on persistence. Finally, we demonstrate the approach using simple simulations and provide a framework for users to explore eco-evolutionary IBMs as tools for understanding adaptation in changing seas.",

      "abstractNote": "Single-gene speciation is considered to be unlikely, but an excellent example is found in land snails, in which a gene for left-right reversal has given rise to new species multiple times. This reversal might be facilitated by their small population sizes and maternal effect (i.e., delayed inheritance, in which an individual's phenotype is determined by the genotype of its mother). Recent evidence suggests that a pleiotropic effect of the speciation gene on antipredator survival may also promote speciation. Here we theoretically demonstrate that, without a pleiotropic effect, in small populations the fixation probability of a recessive mutant is higher than a dominant mutant, but they are identical for large populations and sufficiently weak selection. With a pleiotropic effect that increases mutant viability, a dominant mutant has a higher fixation probability if the strength of viability selection is sufficiently greater than that of reproductive incompatibility, whereas a recessive mutant has a higher fixation probability otherwise. Delayed inheritance increases the fixation probability of a mutant if viability selection is sufficiently weaker than reproductive incompatibility. Our results clarify the conflicting effects of viability selection and positive frequency-dependent selection due to reproductive incompatibility and provide a new perspective to single-gene speciation theory.",

      "abstractNote": "A steady influx of a single deleterious multilocus genotype will impose genetic load on the resident population and leave multiple descendants carrying various numbers of the foreign alleles. Provided that the foreign types are rare at equilibrium, and all immigrant genes are eventually eliminated by selection, the population structure can be inferred explicitly from the branching process taking place within a single immigrant lineage. Unless the migration and recombination rates were high, this novel method gives a close approximation to the simulation with all possible multilocus genotypes considered. Once the load and the foreign genotypes frequencies are known, it becomes possible to estimate selection acting on the invading modifiers of (i) dominance and (ii) recombination rate on the foreign gene block. We found that the modifiers of the (i) type are able to invade faster than the type (ii) modifier, however, this result only applies in the strong selection/low migration/low recombination scenario. Varying the number of genes in the immigrant genotype can have a non-monotonic effect on the migration load and the modifier\u2019s invasion rate: although blocks carrying more genes can give rise to longer lineages, they also experience stronger selection pressure. The heaviest load is therefore imposed by the genotypes carrying moderate numbers of genes.",

      "abstractNote": "There is a long tradition in population genetics of exploring the maintenance of variation under migration\u2013selection balance using deterministic models that assume infinite population size. With finite population size, stochastic dynamics can greatly reduce the potential for the maintenance of polymorphism, but this has yet to be explored in detail. Here, classical two-patch models are extended to predict: (1) the probability of a locally beneficial mutation rising in frequency in the patch where it is favored and (2) the critical threshold migration rate above which the maintenance of polymorphism is much less likely. Individual-based simulations show that these approximations provide accurate predictions across a wide range of parameter space.",

      "abstractNote": "Observations about the number, frequency, effect size, and genomic distribution of alleles associated with complex traits must be interpreted in light of evolutionary process. These characteristics, which constitute a trait\u2019s genetic architecture, can dramatically affect evolutionary outcomes in applications from agriculture to medicine, and can provide a window into how evolution works. Here, I review theoretical predictions about the evolution of genetic architecture under spatially homogeneous, global adaptation as compared with spatially heterogeneous, local adaptation. Due to the tension between divergent selection and migration, local adaptation can favor \u201cconcentrated\u201d genetic architectures that are enriched for alleles of larger effect, clustered in a smaller number of genomic regions, relative to expectations under global adaptation. However, the evolution of such architectures may be limited by many factors, including the genotypic redundancy of the trait, mutation rate, and temporal variability of environment. I review the circumstances in which predictions differ for global vs local adaptation and discuss where progress can be made in testing hypotheses using data from natural populations and lab experiments. As the field of comparative population genomics expands in scope, differences in architecture among traits and species will provide insights into how evolution works, and such differences must be interpreted in light of which kind of selection has been operating.",

      "abstractNote": "Many ecologically important traits have a complex genetic basis, with the potential for mutations at many different genes to shape the phenotype. Even so, studies of local adaptation in heterogeneous environments sometimes find that just a few quantitative trait loci (QTL) of large effect can explain a large percentage of observed differences between phenotypically divergent populations. As high levels of gene flow can swamp divergence at weakly selected alleles, migration\u2013selection\u2013drift balance may play an important role in shaping the genetic architecture of local adaptation. Here, we use analytical approximations and individual-based simulations to explore how genetic architecture evolves when two populations connected by migration experience stabilizing selection toward different optima. In contrast to the exponential distribution of allele effect sizes expected under adaptation without migration (Orr 1998), we find that adaptation with migration tends to result in concentrated genetic architectures with fewer, larger, and more tightly linked divergent alleles. Even if many small alleles contribute to adaptation at the outset, they tend to be replaced by a few large alleles under prolonged bouts of stabilizing selection with migration. All else being equal, we also find that stronger selection can maintain linked clusters of locally adapted alleles over much greater map distances than weaker selection. The common empirical finding of QTL of large effect is shown to be expected with migration in a heterogeneous landscape, and these QTL may often be composed of several tightly linked alleles of smaller effect.",

      "title": "Local Adaptation by Alleles of Small Effect",
      "abstractNote": "Population genetic models predict that alleles with small selection coefficients may be swamped by migration and will not contribute to local adaptation. But if most alleles contributing to standing variation are of small effect, how does local adaptation proceed? Here I review predictions of population and quantitative genetic models and use individual-based simulations to illustrate how the architecture of local adaptation depends on the genetic redundancy of the trait, the maintenance of standing genetic variation (V(G)), and the susceptibility of alleles to swamping. Even when population genetic models predict swamping for individual alleles, considerable local adaptation can evolve at the phenotypic level if there is sufficient V(G). However, in such cases the underlying architecture of divergence is transient: F(ST) is low across all loci, and no locus makes an important contribution for very long. Because this kind of local adaptation is mainly due to transient frequency changes and allelic covariances, these architectures will be difficult--if not impossible--to detect using current approaches to studying the genomic basis of adaptation. Even when alleles are large and resistant to swamping, architectures can be highly transient if genetic redundancy and mutation rates are high. These results suggest that drift can play a critical role in shaping the architecture of local adaptation, both through eroding V(G) and affecting the rate of turnover of polymorphisms with redundant phenotypic effects.",

      "title": "Predicting adaptation under migration load: the role of genetic skew",
      "abstractNote": "Quantitative genetics models have been used to predict the constraints on local adaptation caused by gene flow between populations under migration-selection balance. One key assumption of this approach is that genetic values within a population are normally distributed. Gene flow, however, may generate distributions that are skewed toward the immigrant's mean value. If the response to selection from a skewed distribution is different from that expected under the assumption of normality, models may result in inaccurate predictions. We use individual-based computer simulations to explore this problem, comparing our results to a recent model developed by Hendry et al. (2001). We show that this model underestimates the equilibrium divergence between populations at migration-selection balance. The extent of this underestimation is correlated with the amount of genetic skew generated by migration and is partly explained by the fact that the analytical model ignores direct selection against hybrid phenotypes. We also show that all else being equal, response to selection in a population with a skewed distribution of genotypes is greater than in a population with normally distributed genotypes. The production of skew under migration-selection balance, however, is itself dependent upon the genetic architecture, with greater deviations from normality produced when alleles contributing to population differentiation have very different effect sizes. We find that both the skew and discrepancies between the models are greatest at intermediate migration rates and moderate to strong selection, which is exactly the region of parameter space that is most empirically relevant.",

      "abstractNote": "Coevolutionary interactions between species are thought to be an important cause of evolutionary diversification. Despite this general belief, little theoretical basis exists for distinguishing between the types of interactions that promote diversification and those types that have no effect or that even restrict it. Using analytical models and simulations of phenotypic evolution across a metapopulation, we show that coevolutionary interactions promote diversification when they impose a cost of phenotype matching, as is the case for competition or host-parasite antagonism. In contrast, classical coevolutionary arms races have no tendency to promote or inhibit diversification, and mutualistic interactions actually restrict diversification. Together with the results of recent phylogenetic and ecological studies, these results suggest that the causes of diversification in many coevolutionary systems may require reassessment.",

      "abstractNote": "Seed and breeding zones traditionally are delineated based on local adaptation of phenotypic traits associated with climate variables, an approach requiring long-term field experiments. In this study, we applied a landscape genomics approach to delineate seed and breeding zones for lodgepole pine. We used a gradient forest (GF) model to select environment-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using three SNP datasets (full, neutral and candidate) and 20 climate variables for 1906 lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) individuals in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. The two GF models built with the full (28 954) and candidate (982) SNPs were compared. The GF models identified winter-related climate as major climatic factors driving genomic patterns of lodgepole pine\u2019s local adaptation. Based on the genomic gradients predicted by the full and candidate GF models, lodgepole pine distribution range in British Columbia and Alberta was delineated into six seed and breeding zones. Our approach is a novel and effective alternative to traditional common garden approaches for delineating seed and breeding zone, and could be applied to tree species lacking data from provenance trials or common garden experiments.",

      "abstractNote": "How phenotypic variances of quantitative traits are influenced by the heterogeneity in environment is an important problem in evolutionary biology. In this study, both genetic and environmental variances in a plastic trait under migration-mutation-stabilizing selection are investigated. For this, a linear reaction norm is used to approximate the mapping from genotype to phenotype, and a population of clonal inheritance is assumed to live in a habitat consisting of many patches in which environmental conditions vary among patches and generations. The life cycle is assumed to be selection-reproduction-mutation-migration. Analysis shows that phenotypic plasticity is adaptive if correlations between the optimal phenotype and environment have become established in both space and/or time, and it is thus possible to maintain environmental variance (VE) in the plastic trait. Under the special situation of no mutation but maximum migration such that separate patches form an effective single-site habitat, the genotype that maximizes the geometric mean fitness will come to fixation and thus genetic variance (VG) cannot be maintained. With mutation and/or restricted migration, VG can be maintained and it increases with mutation rate but decreases with migration rate; whereas VE is little affected by them. Temporal variation in environmental quality increases VG while its spatial variance decreases VG. Variation in environmental conditions may decrease the environmental variance in the plastic trait.",

      "abstractNote": "A genetic model for the dynamics of a quantitative trait is analyzed in terms of gene frequencies, linkage disequilibria, and environmental effects on the trait. In a randomly mating population, at each generation progeny move to niches where they are subject to weak Gaussian selection on the trait, with different fitness levels in the different niches. Initially, the variability of the trait is due to additive loci with heterozygous homeostasis. The evolution of plasticity is then described in terms of the invasion of the population by genetic modifiers that may epistatically affect the trait, its optimum in each niche, the strengths of selection, and other parameters characteristic of the niches. We show that the evolution of trait means within niches depends on the overall evolution in the whole system, and in general, optimum phenotypic values are not attained. The reaction norm and genotype-environment interaction may evolve even if the only effects of the modifier are on individual rates of dispersal, or on fitness effects resulting from the different environments in the different niches; this evolution does not require that the modifier affect parameters that influence the values of the trait. It is conjectured that in the least frequently reached niches with low fitness levels, the deviations from the trait optima should be larger than those in more commonly experienced and less stringent niches. Our analysis makes explicit the different contribution of between- and within-niche effects on the evolutionary dynamics of phenotypic plasticity in heterogeneous environments.",
