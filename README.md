# Database of Theoretical Models of Local Adaptation

A comprehensive online resource designed to catalog and analyze theoretical models of local adaptation. This project is associated with **Simon Fraser University** and is currently **in progress**. Certain data in the website could be incorrect at this point.

## Features

### Website Overview
- **Comprehensive Database**: Catalogs a wide range of publications containing Local Adaptation theoretical models, complete with detailed metadata for advanced filtering and analysis.
- **Search Functionality**: Enables users to do advanced search and return all papers containing a specific model or matching certain attribute keywords.
- **Weak Match Identification**: Highlights papers with models that differ by 1, 2, or more attributes from the user-selected filters.

### Interactive Data Visualization
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Provides tools like histograms, pie charts, and a custom tree graph to help map relationships between publications.
- **Tree Graph**: Displays the model space, illustrating connections between papers that use similar models as edges and grouping papers with the same model in the same node.
- **Filter Integration**: Visualizations can dynamically update based on user-selected filters.
